We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Review your investment asset allocation!** Some suggestions on how to do this:

* Gather data on your fund selections in each investment account that you have. Include any investment account: IRAs, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans, TSP accounts, taxable brokerage accounts, and so on.
* Figure out what percentage of your overall allocation across accounts is allocated to domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds.
  * You can do this by looking up each fund at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), viewing the fund information on the company website, or just search for the fund name or ticker symbol plus the word ""prospectus"".
  * On [Morningstar Instant X-Ray](https://www.morningstar.com/portfolio.html?requestUrl=/RtPort/Free/InstantXRayDEntry.aspx) (free registration required) or [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio/) (after entering investments, click on the ""Exposures"" tab and scroll to ""Asset Allocation""), you can enter each of your investments and it will return your overall allocation.
  * If you use [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) and have linked your investment accounts, just click on ""Allocation"" under the ""Investing"" menu.
* **Don't panic!** Whatever the result is, the last thing you want to do is change your allocation without doing additional research, reading, and figuring out what you want your overall allocation to be. 

The goal of this exercise is to ensure that you're invested the way you want to be invested. For example, if you want a 20% bond allocation, is that what you have? If you want 35% of your stock investments to be international, are you reasonably close to that? (These are just examples, not recommendations.)

For more information on allocations, here are some recommended readings:

* [From our Investing Wiki: Can you just recommend something extreme specific to get me started?](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_can_you_just_recommend_something_extremely_specific_to_get_me_started.3F)
* [From our Investing Wiki: What bond percentage should I have?](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_what_bond_percentage_should_i_have.3F)
* [From our wiki: 401(k) fund selection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds)  
* [Boglehead background reading on asset allocation](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation)

Use the comments to discuss your allocation, any questions you might have, or if you're wondering what you can do about them.               

Now is also a great time to make a [Personal Financial Statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-financial-statement.asp). These are used to track financial health over time, so keep your past records accessible in the spreadsheet program of your choice.

t3_bznn9z,Is it wrong to apply for other jobs to see what I’m worth?,"Some days I wonder if I would get paid more working for a different company.
I am happy at my job with the work I do, but would obviously love to be paid more.
Is it wrong/is there any reason why I shouldn’t shop myself around to see what else I could get?

Thanks!

Edit 1: thanks to everyone for your responses. I am now leaning towards thinking I will see what is available.
I do think it would be rude to apply for these jobs just to see what I’m worth and turn them down without considering them. So I will keep an open mind!",1
t3_bzc1x4,always get a debt verification letter!,"follow up to the $25 medical debt collection post... In addition to the debt being outside of my state's 6 year statute of limitations,

I called the billing department of the medical provider to understand the various lines on the original bill that the creditor sent in response to my debt verification letter.

The representative in the billing department told me that the medical provider billing department has gotten a lot of these calls recently and it turns out that one of the debt collection agencies they use put a new system in place that has resulted in many debt collection letters for services provided in 2012, 2013, and 2014 going out. She also said that they've found out that letters are being sent for debts previously collected!",1
t3_bzk3t7,Do people REALLY have emergency funds with 20k+ just sitting there? How do you not touch it?,"Hello hello! Really simple question I'm just having trouble wrapping my head around.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm young, I make good money, I'm not BAD with money, but I've never had an emergency fund over 5k. I've come to realize my e-fund should be more like 25k+. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys do to keep yourself from spending your emergency fund? It makes complete sense to have 6 months salary saved up for emergencies but the idea of having that much just... *sitting there* is a bit difficult.",1
t3_bzpaq2,Just found out I'm 100k in debt,"TLDR: Not counting my house and car payment, I have just over 100k debt. Any recommendations on how to even start attacking this problem? Im a 33 disabled US Veteran with a good job that requires a security clearance, so bankruptcy isn't an option.

&amp;#x200B;

So for some backstory, and to help me get this off my chest, my wife and I are very different people when it comes to money. I hate spending money while my wife is the exact opposite. Every time I have bought a car I feel near panic attack level of anxiety when signing the papers. I don't want this to come across as me bashing my wife because I am just as much as fault as she is for our current financial situation, although for different reasons. We have always managed money very differently and it was always a fight, so early on in our relationship (about 7 years ago) I stepped away completely from our finances because I have always made good money, she has a bachelor's in business management, and she work in finance for years. In order for me to not be constantly stressed out by the lack of a security blanket fund or anything I decided to go full ignorant. I can't be stressed about a problem I don't know we have, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Well I obviously had my head in the sand for much too long. Tonight she mentioned how we are over-drafted until my paycheck on Friday. This has been a more and more common issue as of late and she seemed genuinely concerned. My typical answer of ""we just need to be more strict with spending and pick up the loose ends"" wasn't cutting it anymore, so I look a look at our bills/credit cards/loans and was shocked to see that we have over 100k in debt. I would be lying to say that I'm not mad at her for not seeing/addressing this problem until now, but at the same time I am even more angry at myself for turning a blind eye to this for the sake of avoiding a fight with my wife. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my plan is to personally take over all our finances. I am going to go through everything in detail, make a plan to snowball this debt, stop spending on all credit cards, and cancel all unnecessary expenses. Right now my main concern is if we even have enough income to pay all the minimum payments on the cards and loans, while still paying for all our bills without using another card. 

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said, what advice and resources can anyone recommend to help?",1
t3_bznxn1,As a SAHM how can I contribute to the household? [Serious],"So for a little background, I am a professional certified pet groomer (dogs and cats) [I have all my own supplies and tools] , I crotchet, I can do acrylic nails (and have all the supplies to do so) , I also know how to cut mens hair (also have all the tools to do so) and have been trained on the basics of hair coloring and have done that as well, I am also a decent artist.  I gave up my career as a groomer a little before I had my son, roughly two years ago. We have acquired some debt due to our own fault and also due to being a one income household living in one of the highest cost of living states. I want to help.  I feel worthless. I have so many things I can do but I don't know where to start. I am horrible at advertising or promoting myself. I tried etsy for my crocheting but failed miserably because I'm not good at business. I'm good at what I do but I'm not a business woman. I'm willing to do other things too but I dont know what I could do while staying home with my son. Do you have any suggestions?

t3_bzez8u,Recent Grad and just started my full time job. I can’t tell if I’m doing well or not with finances.,"Okay so I just graduated a month ago and landed a full time job as a Software Engineer in Upstate NY. I’ll break down my finances down below and appreciate any advices you guys have for me. I’m just trying to set practices in place that will ensure my well being in the future. I’m also planning on moving out by end the end of the month with my girlfriend and a buddy from college. Also I should mention that I don’t technically have to start paying my student loans until about mid November but planned to start repayment after a full month of working. I do want to buy a house with the next 3-4 years either as a personal house or just to rent it out. Am I managing my money correctly or is there some inherent flaw in what I’m doing?

Income: $75,000 (before tax)

Student Loan: $25,000 (I really want to pay this off in 4 years or less which would come out to about $550. But maybe that’s a mistake and I should invest half that money instead? Idk)

Car Payment: $275/month

401k: 8% with 8% employer match

Rent: $550/month (utilities not included)

Health Insurance: N/A (still under parents)

Dental/Vision: $23/month

Utilities: ~$50

Food: ~$120 

Gym: ~$20

Hair: ~$20

Renters Insurance: unsure if this is necessary or not

Cell: currently still on parents plan (shhh)

Currently I have ~$4000 in checkings, which I consider my savings.

I do plan on creating a savings just for emergency funds and I plan on putting in around $10-15k in the account for rainy days. Too much? Too little? I have no idea. But I think that should be able to support me for about 4 months if anything drastic happens.

I haven’t started investing in stocks or anything because 

     1) I don’t know a whole lot about stocks and       investments

     2) I’ve been working full time for less than a month and wanted to take a month or two to adjust my budget for what my expenses will actually end up looking like.






****
Currently at work. I appreciate everyone giving me feedback and I’ll try to reply to everything to the best of my ability.

Updated expenses.

Thank you everyone for all the amazing feedback. I feel a lot more confident about what steps to take next and just knowing my options is very comforting. I didn’t expect to get such a big response, this has been very helpful. Thanks again!",1
t3_bzpqi5,"Experian is warning me of a ""thin file"" with four (4) open lines of credit.","I'm 49 and have had credit for years:  Multiple mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, bankruptcy with foreclosure back in 2012, and a new mortgage, car loan and CC since 2016. Experian says I need at least one more credit card to not be considered a ""thin file"" to future creditors. Is this legit or simply a way to trick me into one of the cards they are hawking on their site?",1
t3_bzf6uw,I got 50K sitting in the bank and I have no clue what to do with it or whom to trust,"I approached a couple of banks and I am treated like a factory item. I am given a quiz on risk and offered a cookie cutter solution. I don't feel this is the right approach for me as I would like to work with someone who will look into my finances as a whole, my goals, life milestones etc.  Not one place recommended I do things like ""pay off my mortgage"" or ""pay off all debt"" they are quick to rush me into a set of prepackaged mutual funds. Is there a service or a place I can go to that will look at my financials in its entirety and give me solid advice? I'm in Ontario Canada if that helps.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their support. Some additional info:

- I already own a rental property which I picked up 10 years ago.
-I have RRSPs with about 30k in there. I have plenty of room to add more. 
-I already have 5k in emergency funds in PayPal. I'm sure I could top this up some more.
-Zero debt besides mortgages",1
t3_bznqg6,Don’t buy the cheapest microwave.,"Simple but helpful advice here. 

I bought the cheapest microwave (700 watts) I could find. It was $45 at Walmart. It does its job but honestly it is soooo slow and takes forever to cook or heat food. And it leaves the bowl or plate extremely hot.

Honestly, once this microwave dies out, which it eventually will since it takes twice as long to cook things, I’ll be buying a better quality microwave with higher watts. 

So that $100 microwave may seem crazy expensive for college students like me but honestly if I would’ve thought that I’d be standing in my kitchen at 1am waiting 8 minutes for ramen to cook, I never would’ve bought this one. Among other things as well though. 

Also, try and get a secondhand expensive microwave. You could probably find a 1000+ watt microwave for like $50 on let go or OfferUp.",1
t3_bzm36h,Employer matches exact up to 4%. Matches slightly less after. Worth going beyond?,So again my new employer matches 4%. 5% they’ll match 4.5% and 6% they’ll match 5%. Is that worth it or is my 2% better used elsewhere?,1
t3_bz333z,A tip for your car payoff and credit score,"Perhaps I am naive to the ways of the world, but I thought I’d share my life lesson here for others who might meet the same fate as I.  CHECK YOUR AUTO LOAN!  CHECK YOUR CREDIT SCORE! 

My SO (then BF/now husband) picked out a new (er) car for me once we were engaged.  I’d driven the car my parents got when I was 15 since I was 16.  It was a Sunfire and let’s be real...after 12 years of me driving it and 1 year of my parents driving it...it was time to go.  

I had great credit and qualified easily for a loan and set up payments with the loaning bank for automatic bill pay.  I got the car five years ago and was very excited knowing it would be paid off at the start of this year.  Over the past 5 years since  making the purchase I have gotten married, bought a forever home, had a child, and am pregnant with our second.  I’m pretty on top of things and in charge of finances as my husband is notoriously bad with money.  This January I see the car payment come out and read up on paying off an auto loan.  I learned that sometimes a credit score will drop right after a big loan is paid off, but that it will bounce back within a few months.  

Cue February.  No car payment comes out.  No worries.  I knew we had one or two payments left on the car so I assumed the final payment was made!  Yay!  I checked my credit score on credit karma to find that my score dropped some, but it was to be expected.  I am now over the moon to have completed my first car loan!  

Today I decided to check my score again to see if it had in fact bounced back up.  To my horror I discover my score has fallen an additional 78 points!  I start digging and discover the car loan is claiming I never made the last payment.  After being up all night with anxiety about the situation I get in contact with the bank this morning.  It turns out that this bank ONLY accepts the final payment via phone or mail even with auto bill pay set up.  This bank also will not let you set up online banking with them unless you also open a checking account with them.  A loan account alone will not suffice.  

So the moral of the story is that despite being extremely financially responsible and doing everything I thought I should be doing - shit happens I guess.  Make sure your final loan payment meets all the requirements of the bank and do not assume that auto bill pay ensures that your bill is paid.  

Side note: this bank also does not send paper OR email OR phone notices when a payment is missed.  So despite 5 years of on time payments - there was no notification that the final payment did not occur.  It was only checking my credit score that alerted me to the situation.  Had I not checked it I hate to think the outcome given the account was now 90 days late.  So now I’m coming to grips with my “fair” credit score and mostly thankful that I have no major purchases in the near future where my score would be needed.  

TLDR:  make sure your final loan payment does not have to be made via phone or mail.  It turns it that auto bill pay does not necessarily mean that payment is made if the bank has stipulations saying otherwise.

Edit:  Bank is BMO Harris.  It is not local to me.

Edit 2: For those asking - I live in Illinois where it has taken 2 months to get a new drivers license mailed to me.  Where it takes months and months to renew a FOID card despite the only change being that you are a few years older and actually had it updated three years earlier when changing last names.  This was my first car loan and I had no prior knowledge on the timeframe needed to process a legal document given how long everything else in this state takes.  I had decided to reach out or look into it more if I didn’t get anything within the next month or so when all this went down.  I’m feeling rather foolish about the entire thing and hope that sharing can help some others from potentially going down the same path.

UPDATE:  First - thanks for the advice on helping my credit score (as scammy as credit score can be).  I just got the opportunity to sit down and call the bank (rascally two year old needed worn out before a long phone call was possible).  It took some transferring around and initially they were going to have me submit some paperwork for review.  I made sure to ask all the little questions suggested and point out 59 perfect payments previously and the lack of contact from them.  This lead to the credit dispute person speaking to her supervisor.  After she returned to the call she said her supervisor said to go ahead and bypass my submission and that they would submit a retraction with the credit places and that it should be resolved within 14 days.  

I rephrased everything she said they were doing to get a second confirmation I was understanding correctly.  She verified and even said this is a recorded call so she is being completely direct with me and not just telling me what I want to hear.  So hopefully in the next 14 days I will have a title in hand and my credit score will be sparkling again.  Thanks again for everyone who encouraged me to call back and continue to ask to speak with whoever needed to make this go away.",1
t3_bzngvk,Should I start a SIMPLE 401K?,"Hey guys. I’m going to try and keep this as short and simple as possible. If more in-depth info is needed, I can certainly provide it.

I work for a small family business and I get a SIMPLE 401K sheet from them every year. Never really looked into it much because I needed the money for bills etc. It basically says I can pick a financial institution of my choice but doesn’t have a ton of info. My wife contributes to her 401K every check as she works for a big company. My wife and I have about $305k in good debt from mortgage that we owe. We carry $0 in bad debt and pay off credit cards in full every month. We’re looking to pay our mortgage debt off with some money we acquired in a will. Once this happens I would like to begin saving for retirement and considered the SIMPLE 401k that my employer offers.

Basically I have a few questions I’m hoping to get more info on. First, can anyone give me more info on what the SIMPLE 401K is and what, if any, differences it has vs a standard 401K? Secondly, are there any other better options rather than going with the SIMPLE 401K? What are those and what would the pros/cons be?

Thanks in advance for any info and advice. Sorry for bad formatting since I’m on mobile.",1
t3_bzdt14,Help With Opening a New Account Without My Father.,"Hi everyone. 

I [19f] currently bank with Regions. I am in college, and I have a joint student bank account with my father [56m]. He is able to see where I move my money, and has alerts sent to his phone every time I spend something/move money to/from my account. I feel very uncomfortable having him keep such a watchful eye over my money, and I would really like to start opening a bank account that is personally my own and not attached to his. I feel strongly about this now because I just started a summer job that pays me very well. It would also be helpful to note that he is incredibly narcissistic and I am not sure how to approach this issue with him, as i’m sure it would be quite suspicious to move $2,000 from my student account into a new bank account without letting him know. it feels like a form of control over me for him to be able to view my money and have alerts every time a dollar moves. How should I approach this with him? How should I talk to my regions bank about my account and how to move my personal money? Any advice would be super helpful. Thank you.",1

t3_bzq9bv,Buying my first car. Are these financing options do-able?,"
Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile. 

I currently make about 65K a year, have about 37K saved up and about 4K in my checking. 

No credit card bill (as it’s always paid end of the month and on time). I also don’t pay rent, water, electricity (very lucky for my situation)

I am looking to buy my first own car.
Mazda CX3 for 53200 (not in US currency, but just to keep it simple. All figures are the same currency though)

I’ve been offered two different financing possibilities.

Downpayment of 20K (from my savings, so this will bring my savings to about 17K) on the car and either 671 a month for 5 years with a 6 month break OR same downpayment and 484 a month for 7 years, no 6 month break. 

The plan is to buy my own car this year and move out (thus paying rent of about 1100 a month) 

I expect to make 70 next year and 75k 2 years after that. 

What do I do?

t3_bzm7xe,Something about my new employer seems...off.,"I started a new job on Sunday! Which is great! It's a doggy daycare and I really love it.

However.A couple of things have kinda stood out to me as...strange.

To start, I've never had a job where the first day of being officially hired on, I didn't fill out any kind of paperwork. No W4, (no tax information whatsoever), no bank information for depositing checks, nothing.

Second, we have timecards where like the employee just fills out the dates &amp; times they work on their card that has their name on it. I asked the manager (shes only one of three other people that work there; her and the two owners) if I should make one and she said ""Not yet. I'll make you one whenever it's time for you to need one.""

So like... no one is keeping any kind of official track of my hours? Besides me?

LIKE AM I EVEN GOING TO GET PAID??? I may just ask when I go in tomorrow. If not I'm definitely not going back, considering that's illegal.

Idk it has all just come off as really strange to me. And I've worked for a small business before and it wasn't like this.

Any thoughts??",1

t3_bzpu1w,Use CDs to pay for rent?,"I recently learned about cd ladders and am finally in a position to put money away and don't want money sitting in savings.

The plan's to put money in different cds and pull them when they hit maturity date and use that money to pay for the next month's rent. I've been homeless a good chunk of my life, so having money for housing is important to me. I figure by putting money away in cds, I won't be able to touch it for awhile, they'll mature , i'll be able to pay rent and (doubt it, but who knows) maybe make some extra cash by the end of the year/lease.

I plan to put away about 1k (maybe more) per cd at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 month increments.

t3_bznqcg,My credit score dropped 118 points," It's a little late, but I decided to check my experian since I disputed a  fraudulently opened account about a month ago. When I logged in I  noticed my score had dropped 118 points. I worked so hard to get my  scores up after this ID theft. I'm going to call the number experian has  listed for disputes of ID theft. The account was opened in 2016 but I  didn't find out about it until 2018. I disputed through equifax and  transunion first and it appears they removed it from my report. After  that I had to rebuild with a secured card. After that I created an  account with experian and noticed the fraudulent account was still  reporting with them. I thought nothing of it for a few months until I  finally decided to dispute it through them as well. I figured it worked  with the other 2 so why not. Today I go to check my scores and see if  there's an update on my dispute. my score dropped from 743 to 625.  Credit rating went from very good to fair. Does anyone have any  experience with this? Will calling the number provided help at all?  This is what I got from experian:  The information you disputed has been verified as accurate; however,  information unrelated to your dispute has been updated.  Please review  your report for the details. I reviewed it and there's really nothing helpful there. No changes. Why would this cause my score to drop so drastically.",1

* I have significant experience in the discipline they're hiring for, but will be new to the industry.

* They're building out this discipline new to the company. Have hired 1 so far, looking for 3-4 more. They're moving fast and have indicated that they need to hire immediately.

* They've also indicating needing someone with significant experience in the discipline who can work well with ambiguity as they have very few processes in place. Really looking for a senior level hire, which I feel I am.

I *may* have another job offer coming my way that WILL pay significantly more ($10K - $20K). I don't really want this other job though. I'd take it if it were the only opportunity, but it sounds like boring work. If I currently had a job, I'd use this other job as negotiation. But I'm a bit worried it may seem weird to the dream job company that I've been out of work for 6+ months then suddenly got 2 offers within days of each other.

I would definitely take this dream job at the current rate, because dream job. I just hate leaving all the extra $$$ on the table. Is it going to look sketch if I try to negotiate for more? I don't want them to think I'm a liar, take back the job offer, and force me to settle for something else.",1

Long story short, I recently met up with someone whom wanted to set me up for life insurance- initially I thought, “great cool!” And gave all my information to this old “friend” to do a estimate for me. I haven’t heard from him since April 2019.

3 months later I received mail from NWM saying “we need more proof in order to move forward- NO INSURANCE HAS BEEN IN EFFECT AT ANYTIME”

But, I’ve checked my statement on the account card I gave (which I only use for emergency) and it was charged 3x for $289.00 from the months passed.

My question is, can I go to my bank show this letter and get my money back? I’ve never done a chargeback but have looked at it extensively- does this count as an “unauthorized charge?”

I have very little experience in the department, but the work seems intriguing. I'd like to accept the offer.

So I watch a few youtube videos and then created one. I am assuming that I didn't set it up correctly.

I sell on Amazon, and also buy on amazon, so I was using the TID to not pay sales tax when purchasing and then to collect sales tax when selling items.

I really had/have no idea what I am doing and never consulted with an account, again, what a dumbass.

So, I was selling on Amazon before I set up the LLC and then I added the TID to collect sales tax/ not pay sales tax, and then recently (yesterday) took the TID off the account so I no longer use it.

I have received the letter attached and I feel like I have screwed myself over big time. 

Since receiving the letter I have filed my articles of dissolution ( still not even sure if that is what I have to do to dissolve it completely or not). And have been looking up a lot and realize that I do not need an LLC and can just claim it on my personal taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for advice. I feel like I may have screwed myself over because adding the TID to collect sales tax midway through the year and only having it on there for a couple of months may mess up my taxes for this year.

 

 I am also worried that I will have to pay a lot more that the $775 it says because I formed the LLC on March 28,2019 and just dissolved it on June 10,2019.

I was recently two months late on my credit card payments due to my mother being diagnosed with a terminal illness and me taking a leave of absence from work during this period. I have finally got that all settled out, all late fees were refunded, and accounts 'rehabbed'. I currently have zero balance on all of my cards. I have four credit cards and one federal student loan account. I have an amazon prime visa card with a limit of $1,000, a Walmart mastercard with a $520 limit, a care credit account for healthcare with a $1000 limit, and a Kohls store only credit card with a $300 limit. My student loans are around \~$5,000 and are deferred until 6 months after I graduate from my nursing program.

&amp;#x200B;

My oldest card is the Kohl's card which is \~4 years old, my Walmart mastercard is my second oldest at around the same time frame. My friend suggested that I should close the Kohl's card, amazon card, and possibly the care credit account - just keeping the Walmart mastercard to continue to build my credit as it's my oldest credit card that can be used anywhere. I haven't used the kohl's card in over a year and really have no use for it. My credit score is currently poor due to over utilization in the past, short history, and I'm guessing my missed payments over the past two months. I only opened a care credit account because I needed urgent dental work so I'm not sure if this is something I need to keep open or if it's hurting me or not. At the time it was needed, but now I could probably just use my regular credit card for medical stuff if needed. All of them have similar interest rates.

The company I’m with now, I’ve been with during my entire electrical career. In my first summer, before starting school, my boss paid me $11/hr., upped it to $12/ hr. My second summer &amp; I got a nice raise to $15/hr. During my third and final summer prior to graduating. All of these were just given to me w/o asking. And I think it’s safe to say that my boss gave me the larger raise during my final summer in an attempt to persuade me to come on full-time. 

Upon graduating, in October of ‘17, my boss called me and told me to name my price and he’d see what he could do. I said $ 18/hr. And he agreed immediately.

I’ve been st that same wage since. Things have been going well. I have hiccups here &amp; there, as any apprentice will. All part of getting experience &amp; learning. But nothing major. My boss had always sent me out with a journeyman in the past but now, as I’ve learned more, and given our compsny’s Current situation, which I’ll address next, I’ve been going to job sites on my own more and more.

I’m located in rural Midwest, a small town of 1,000 people. My company is a small company - my boss just went out on his own roughly 6 years ago. 

Two months ago, our crew consisted of 4 electricians, not including my boss. One left right around two months ago, putting our crew at 3. A couple of weeks later, another was diagnosed with cancer &amp; he will be out for the foreseeable future, putting our crew to 2, not including our boss. He has not been looking up replace them. 

Given the circumstances, I think $20/hour should be attainable. However, the other remaining crew member is currently making $20/hr. And he IS a journeyman, of about 1- 2 years. I know MY salary does not, or should not depend on his. The kicker, though, is that he is my boss’s nephew, so I think my boss knows that he is unlikely to leave. I, on the other hand, do not envision myself remaining at this company long-term.

I also want to note that the two journeymen who are not with us anymore were 28 &amp; 32 years old &amp; were both making $27.50/hr., which I feel is low and may affect my situation.

I almost accepted a new job in the Twin Cities a couple of weeks ago, but it didn’t make financial sense in the short-term. I finished school late, with a bit of debt/m. I figure once I have my journeyman’s license in 18 months, I’ll be in a much better spot to make that move. 

Any advice? Should I ask for $20/hour? If not, how much?

Im looking for accommodation for next year, most places have been taken and after my last couple years, I have a very specific idea of where I want to live for possibly my last year. The Dutch government gives out student financing if you meet certain criteria, one of which being working 56 hours per month. I believe I have made a plan that will get me everything I want, and make add to my savings by the end of my degree. [If somebody could go over my plan](https://imgur.com/M6G6BwZ), maybe find something Ive missed or could improve on, I would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Note: The amounts that are going into my savings are realistic, but most likely unobtainable due to the fact that Im planning some holidays for my girlfriend.

t3_bzfnix,Metlife owes me money - and sent me to collections,"I just received a collections notice for an unpaid MetLife bill for $68. I had previously been insured by them and cancelled my policy about 6 months ago. I don't remember ever receiving a bill from them but its possible they sent one I'm not always the best at keeping up with my mail. Now the really ironic part and I double checked to verify but Metlife actually owes me $85. They had sent me a check in December because of an overpayment that I never deposited (again, bad with mail) and recently sent me a notice saying I hadn't deposited the check which is now expired and offering to send another one. So needless to say I was a bit surprised to see I was sent to collections over an unpaid bill when the balance of the bill is less than the company actually owes me? Is it possible the collections notice is a scam? Also what can I do to not have this effect my credit, I know I've demonstrated I'm not the best with keeping up with my mail (had our first child recently and I've been a little busy) but I do have excellent credit, pay my bills on time, I've never had a missed payment (minus this current situation), can I work with the collection agency to have the bill removed from my credit if it is valid? I have no problems paying it, this whole situation is just bizarre to me. Thanks for any advice!",1

t3_bzla94,Tools and tactics for buying a new car,"Over the last three years, I've gone through as many vehicles. Life changes, mechanical failures, and shifting needs all contributed to this unfortunate and needless shuffling of vehicles. Due to this, however, and having encountered a variety of sale tactics and personalities, I've noticed a few patterns, and developed a working strategy that today landed me a new Hyundai Accent for 15,500, with a free extended warranty. I decided that since I spend so much time on Reddit, I'd share these tips, tools, and tactics with you all! Hopefully, we can get even more in the comments.


To make this as simple as possible, I'm just going to go through my most recent buying experience and explain how I did it. The first step, as anyone will tell you, is research! My weapon of choice was cars.usnews.com. This site gives you a clear ranking of cars, trucks, etc, and what their current year models are all about. With my 21 year old Z3 in the shop and looking like it's not cut out to be a daily driver, I decided to buy a second vehicle strictly to serve as my commuter, which is about 30-40 minutes every morning. I want cheap and dependable, with an excellent warranty. I decided I would likely sell it after the warranty was up, and move into a new vehicle. 

The reason I wanted a great warranty is because it's a period of time where any malfunctions or problems don't come out of my pocket. It's a perfectly valid strategy to make your car expenses more stable and consistent by buying new cars in warranty, running them to the end of it and maybe a little more if you're confident in its reliability, then trading it in for another new car with a good warranty. As of now, this is my strategy. I expect my Accent should be worth around 3-4k by the end of the warranty, meaning in 5 years when I'll likely be trading it in, if I buy the same car again at the same price, I'll have spent around 2k per year on owning a car. Obviously if I make it past that, my car ownership expense just goes down more and more. As long as you're maintaining the vehicle, this should be doable.

So, with my needs in mind, lets look at [subcompact cars](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/rankings/subcompact-cars). Using the site mentioned before, we get a clear ranking, estimated costs for each vehicle, and stats on each. My options after reading up on each was the [Hyundai Accent](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/hyundai/accent), the [Chevrolet Sonic](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/chevrolet/sonic), and the [Kia Rio](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/kia/rio). The Honda fit didn't make the list because frankly, I find it to be an ugly car. Vain, I know, but that's me. The Cooper didn't make the list due to the price.

Ok, so now I have a list of cars I'm interested in, and an idea of what I can expect on the costs! Now it's time to decide what I'd like to spend. My goal was to try and stay as cheap as possible, as before stated, so I knew I would be looking at strictly base models. I started contacting dealers to get offers. Usually this is best done through Email so you can avoid sales tactics, but as I stated before, I was quite seasoned and confident at this point, and decided to go in person so I could test drive the car, and get a price at the same time. Before heading out to meet the sellers, I checked their sites to see what they were showing, and to establish a baseline cost that I wouldn't ever go over.

First, I tried the rio. It ended up feeling a little timid, but I could live with that, after all I still had my Z3 for fun. They originally offered me a rather high 17,500. For the record, this is like a thousand over even the highest trim MSRP, and we were looking at the LOWEST trim. I set them straight by showing them the same car on their own website, listed at 15,800. I don't know how exactly they thought they were going to get away with that. I asked for 15,000, and I got 15,500 as a counter. Not bad, but at this point, I catch them up to more shenanigans. Men, do not fall for the flirty friendly sales lady! The woman I was working with was lightly flirting while pushing me to buy the first car that I'd investigated at this point. When she was unable to get me to buy that day, they switched tactics, and brought out the loud, more aggressive sales manager. 

This is where one of those patterns comes in, ""What can I give you to earn your business today?"". Your answer to this should be ""You can't, I'm not prepared to buy a car today."". You thank them for their time and offer, and you move on to the next one. Another tactic that I've seen repeatedly, though much more often in used cars, is that the gas tank will be basically empty, severely limiting your test driving range. This is less important for new cars with warranties, but DO NOT let them limit your test driving on a used car by having a basically empty tank. Make them put gas in the car so you can get a proper feel for the vehicle. also, if you do buy used, bear in mind that the big and important warranty probably doesn't transfer!

Now, having drove the Rio, I test drove the Sonic next. I knew this was the underdog due to the warranty being half as good, but I went just to see what was up. They had a 2018 that didn't sell, and had 60 miles on it. Still new, still warrantied. This one had a half tank, good sign! Unfortunately, as expected, they were not able to match the kia and hyundai warranty, so we had to move on. their best offer was 17,600 with the 100k warranty that matched the competition. This car was basically fully loaded, and they weren't prepared to lose their ass to match the Rio. This is where knowing what you want comes in to play. I had an offer for 15,500, and a great factory warranty. They couldn't match both, so I walked.

Next, was the winner, the Hyandai Accent. It was low on gas as well, but I decided that it wasn't my problem and drove it like I stole it! While I don't recommend you do this, I managed to find some space to really put this car through its paces. Much of my commute is back roads, so having a car that performed well in corners would be a boon, so I tested it in that regard. The Rio and Accent were literally identical in every way, except that the Accent had a slightly smaller MFD, the Rio didn't have a FOB, and the Accent was more energetic. At this point I knew that this car would win if they managed to match the Rio.

With my mind made up, I entered my 3rd round of negotiations. I knew going in that I wanted to pay no more than 15,500. If these two cars were the same price, I would take the Accent. I informed them of this, and they came back with an offer of 16,500. I politely but firmly reminded them that I had an offer on a Rio for 15,500, and that if they didn't beat that, I wouldn't buy it. This is where one of my tactics came into play, I told them that I would consider spending a little more than that, if they extended the warranty for free, without any charge or deductible.

The next offer was 15,500, with the warranty I asked for, no deductible, zero down. Some say that no matter what, you should step away from the negotiation for a day to make sure you could think about it and ensure you're getting what you wanted. I didn't feel the need to do this at this point, because I had stuck to my guns, and so my needs had been met and exceeded. signed the paperwork, and will be picking up my new ride Thursday!

I hope this helps someone out there, and prevents you from doing the same car shuffle that I put myself through. Thanks for reading, cheers!",1
t3_bzocd1,"Financial Scum trying to get good, but afraid of losing savings to collectors/IRS","I come from a low-class society, and was raised to irrationally fear money and the government. I have finally worked my way up to a comfortable full-time wage (just below the US standard for a ""living wage""). I am completely ignorant with finances and have spent \~30 years of my life neglecting this area of responsibility. I recently decided to get smart, and spent the last three years paying off all debt (except for my student loans) and rebuilding my credit. I have begun using Mint and reading Personal Finance Reddit and Wiki for guidance, but I feel I am now in a rock and a hard place.

I have never budgeted on paper, as I have managed to survive most of my life from paycheck-to-paycheck (rather well, I must add) budgeting mentally. I am presently trying to learn how, as I recognize the value of this, but I lose track very easily and find it difficult to make the time to catch up. I recently sold my vehicle, and I now have the largest sum of money that I have ever had in my possession at any one time in my life (it's about 2.5 months of salary).

I would like to start an emergency savings account with these new assets, and to start planning for the future. Every time I am about to open the account, however, I get cold feet.  I feel like as soon as I put this money in anyone else's hands (especially an institution), someone is going to take it away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

**The real dilemmas:**

I have never made a payment on my student loans, and don't know where to start. It seems I will never pay them off before I die, and I am emotionally bankrupt regarding them.

I also have been paid under the table by an overseas company for the last five years, and have never filed taxes because I never learned how. I always figured I'm such low finance scum that the IRS would be wasting their own resources coming after me because I have no assets for them to take away. A ""better fish to fry"" scenario.

I DO plan on paying my taxes in Q1 2020, and I am committed to setting things right.  However, what I am really afraid of is: Can I open this savings account? Or have I completely fucked myself over?  Thank you all for your time reading.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I am the scum of finances and new to remedying this. For the first time in my life have a decent sum of money, but I still have student loans in default and have not been paying taxes. If I open an emergency/future savings account with these new liquid assets, do I risk someone taking it away from me?  I do plan on continuing down the path of the financially righteous, but would like to do so with my income and not sacrifice my potential for a savings account.

t3_bzoa21,"I’m paying only $36,000 in total for a foreign degree but receiving a very poor education. Should I ride it out and obtain my diploma or start over in an American university and take out student loans?","Hi Reddit, 

I’m contemplating whether I should make a drastic change to ensure a better financial future for myself. To give you guys a bit of a background about me, I’m an 18 year old college student, currently studying at a “university” called Management Development Institute of Singapore. I placed university in quotation marks because it’s hardly a university. It’s essentially a private institute that more closely resembles a diploma mill rather than a legitimate uni. I enrolled into this school at 17 and have been studying here for almost two years. The academic curriculum is aligned with the British system and the courses are presented in the following order: International Foundation Diploma, Higher Diploma, and Degree. Total length of time before I receive my degree: 2 years and 7 months (with 2 months of break in between the courses). Cost of the courses:

*estimates* 
Foundation Diploma- S$6,790 ($4,900 USD)
Higher Diploma- S$11,800 ($8,660 USD)
Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Psychology - S$31,000 ($22,000 USD) 

Total cost: S$49,590 ($36,320 USD)

As you can see by the figures, I’m paying substantially less compared to U.S. university tuition fees. And yes, the degree is legitimate and comes from an accredited U.K. uni called Coventry University. The program I’m taking now is supposedly a bridging course.  

I’m now in the midst of my Higher Diploma in Psychology and I’m pondering whether I should leave after I’ve completed it. I’m not even closely content with the quality of education I have been receiving. A lot of my course material seems to be just basic filler content with maybe a slight association to the study of psychology. It’s almost as if once we’ve covered the fundamentals, they didn’t know what else to teach us and began adding modules that verge on the brink of irrelevance just to fill in that time. Majority of my lecturers aren’t very competent (aside from a select few) and there seems to be a severe problem with the way they handle administrative matters. So far in every module, we spent a minimum of three lessons going over something we’ve already learned in our previous course. I also suspect that they artificially inflate our scores. When completing a graduation project last year, I had invested close to 70 hours writing my paper. I was quite proud of the end result and received a 93 on it which I thought was sufficient at the time. When comparing results to those of my classmates, I noticed a serious discrepancy within how grading assessments were being done. Upon reading through a fellow student’s paper (which received a 68) I couldn’t believe that someone would even entertain the idea of it being passable. It violated close to 60% of the rubric rules, the entire “research” was based entirely off of four references in total (when the minimum was 12), and had grammatical errors galore. I’d venture it was probably written within a span of a night. 

You might be wondering how I even ended up at this school in the first place. I’ll be perfectly honest, I have been a terrible student throughout high school. I managed to get a decent enough score on my SHSATS in middle school to get into a relatively reputable technical high school in New York but it all went down hill when I began heavily abusing substances. I got expelled halfway through 11th grade due to my addiction and was sent to a Thai rehab for treatment due to it being cost effective. Afterwards, my family didn’t want me returning back to New York, or the States in general, so I began looking for schools in Singapore (primarily due to low drug accessibility) and stumbled upon my current school. I’ve stayed sober since then. 

So due to some terrible life decisions I’ve made in the past, I don’t have many options available to me. If I were to leave my school and move back to the states (where I’m a citizen), this would be my preferred course of action: Obtain a GED, enrol into a decent community college (if possible, something similar to Kirkwood), spend two years working my ass off to ensure my grades are sufficient enough to transfer into a decent state university and receive my degree from there. I’ll probably have to take out student loans to achieve this goal considering my family isn’t very wealthy and I’m not entirely sure they’ll grant them to me considering how horrendous my high school transcripts look (along with my disciplinary record). I fear they’ll categorize me as an unstable candidate and refuse to lend me any money. 

Here is a pro and con list I’ve managed to make so far regarding all the benefits and liabilities:

Pros:
- If I complete my degree, I would graduate by the age of 20 and can begin my job hunt (or pursue a masters). A scenario in which it all works out in a desirable manner would be quite baffling. My numerous fuck ups in life resulting in a favourable outcome would definitely be an unprecedented turn of events. By the time my peers finish their undergrads, I’d (ideally) already have two years of work experience under my belt. 

- It would be the most cost-effective approach and I wouldn’t need to bury myself in debt unless I choose to pursue a masters. 

- I wouldn’t need to move out early and would have another year and a half to plan what to do once I graduate. I am relatively content with living in Singapore and I have a strong recovery network here that I’m afraid of losing (or more like changing). 

Cons: 
- I’m hardly learning anything of value at my school. I’m barely even picking up any life skills such as proper time management or problem solving. Everything is handed to me on a platter and I don’t even need to pay attention in class because the lecturers practically give away exactly what’s going to be on the exams. All I need to do is spend maybe 7-8 hours going over the core content based on what is “hinted” to appear on the exams and am usually able to pass with great marks (GPA currently at a 3.6). The only singular module that proved to be slightly challenging and requiring more effort than usual was statistics. 

- If I choose to pursue a masters soon after, I presume I’m going to be ridiculously overwhelmed with the rigorousness of the curriculum. After having it so easy for the past few years, it’ll be like a kick to the face when I discover what tertiary education is truly like (especially a masters). 

- I’m essentially just paying for a piece of paper and nothing else. The “college experience” just isn’t there. Considering majority of my classmates are also fuck ups that either dropped out or failed O levels, I highly doubt they’d be of any use when it comes to “networking”. 

- I may have chosen a poor major to study. A psychology undergrad is hardly “in demand” and I presume finding decent employment is going to be fairly difficult with just a bachelors. 

Liabilities: 
- If I choose to continue my studies here and receive my diploma from Coventry, how will potential employers regard my foreign degree? If I’m asked in an interview how I enjoyed living and studying in the U.K., how the hell do I explain I never even once set foot in the country? A guidance counsellor advised me that most wont question it and it’ll be indistinguishable but I’m a bit skeptical of her motives.

- Would it be possible to receive this honours degree and complete a masters in an American college once I’m done? I’m slightly worried that most admission committees will request to assess my records prior to uni enrolment. If my foreign degree isn’t adequate enough to enrol into a M.D. program, what must I do then? 

- I fear that it’ll be more difficult for employers and admission committees to check the validity of my degree. Unlike my fellow college students in the U.S., my informational won’t be accessible in the national data bases employers use to confirm the alma mater claims of potential recruits. Although I’m sure it’ll be possible for them to do so, the question is whether it’ll just serve as a barrier to entry when a candidate with the exact same set of credentials and work experience can be fact-checked a lot easier. 

I think that pretty much sums up my dilemma. My classmates tell me that our degree-level course is going to be taught by professors flown in from Coventry and they surmise that our curriculum is going to be entirely the same as the curriculum at the actual campus. That our two courses are merely bridging programs to prepare us for the degree level course. That does give me a bit of hope. Ultimately, I’m very lost as to what I should do. I’d hate to have to drop out this far into my studies but I fear that I’ll lose even more time and money if I choose to stay. I think I’ll end it here and kindly ask you guys for some advice and what your thoughts are on my predicament.

t3_bzo3et,"My wife and I can't afford a house in our local market, so are considering buying an investment/vacation rental in a mountain resort town 2 hours away. Is this a bad idea?","Here's the details:  We live in Los Angeles.  My wife works in tech, and her current job and any meaningful job changes keep her next to the beach.  That means any house within a commute-able distance and desirable neighborhood is $800K+++, and out of our reach for years.  
We can feasibly buy a house in a popular mountain resort town about 2 hours away for ~$200K.  
Our plan would be to do some cosmetic remodels, and rent the house out on Air BnB.  We have been using Air BnB to rent our our 2nd bedroom in our rental for the last 4 years, so we are very familiar with the platform.  We also really like the town, so there is the draw of us having the house to ourselves if we want to spend a weekend away.  


Is this a bad idea?  Our current plan is ""keep saving, renting, and wait for the next earthquake,"" but this is something we could feasibly do this year to create an investment and start building equity.  We have no idea how much equity is even possible in a resort town, it seems like there is a lot of vacation home turnover and it's also a fairly competitive rental market.  The thing in our favor is that it's a local tourist destination year-round.  

These are our details:  
- Our current rent is $2700 for a 2 bed 2 bath.  Please remember this is LA, we have been here for 4 years, and the price is quite low for the neighborhood.  
- Our combined income is about $160K
- We just paid off our car, so only expense on credit is my student loans, about $200/month.  
- I'm not a licensed contractor, but I'm very comfortable doing simple remodels myself.  I worked as a carpenter in college and have also done lots of minor plumbing work.  
- We have about $40K in savings from hosting Air BnB, which we would use for a down payment without taking anything away from personal savings or retirement.",1

(Replacing company name for privacy and possible legal reasons?)

-----‐--------------

""How Do I Contribute To The Plan?

If you are a new employee, you will be automatically enrolled in the Plan on the Plan entry   date. This means that elective deferrals in the amount of 3% of compensation will    automatically be deducted from your compensation, unless you elect not to participate in the Plan or change or stop your contributions. Your Plan allows you to make elective deferrals up to 100% of your compensation. An annually adjusted Internal Revenue Service (IRS) dollar limit also applies. The dollar limit is $18,000 for 2017.

If you are a current participant and you are contributing less than 3% of compensation, then elective deferrals in the amount of 3% of compensation will automatically be deducted from your compensation, unless you change or stop your contributions. If you are a current   employee and you are not making elective deferrals to the Plan, then 3% of compensation will automatically be deducted from your compensation, unless you elect not to participate in the Plan or change or stop your contributions.

Your Plan also provides for automatic deferral increases of 1% annually, up to a maximum deferral of 6% of pay. See your Benefits Administrator for more information.

You can also designate your salary deferrals to a Plan account that accepts Roth after-tax contributions. In 2017, you may contribute as much as $18,000, in total, to all accounts (Roth after-tax contributions and pre-tax deferrals). Roth contributions will be included as taxable income to the employee. Earnings on the Roth contribution will accumulate tax free, and retirement withdrawals may be exempt from federal income tax.

If you have an existing qualified retirement plan (pre-tax), Roth account or 403(b) tax deferred arrangement with a prior employer, you may transfer or roll over that account into the Plan anytime.

How Does COMPANY Contribute To The Plan?

The Plan also provides for COMPANY to make contributions.

COMPANY will make safe harbor matching contributions of 100% of your contributions that do not exceed 1% of compensation, plus 50% of your contributions that exceed 1% of compensation, but do not exceed 6% of compensation. The safe harbor contribution will be made each payroll period. Other limitations may apply.""

END FAQ!





First of all, I'm not understanding if ""The Plan"" is some kind of unique saving program used by the company, or if they're referring to a regular 401k, seems like each company has their own unique 401k? I don't recall opting in our out of ""The Plan."" I assume they're referring to my 401k since I'm in the PDF for the 401k FAQ.

The main part I'm curious about, as it seems to be the part most beneficial to me, and the part that pertains to my main question here is ""How does COMPANY contribute to the plan?"" (my 401k)

This is a sales job, so it fluctuates, but I'm currently netting 2700 a month on average, so 32k/year. 100% of 1% of compensation is just 1% of my yearly gross correct? So 1% of 32k is $320 dollars, which is what they will match me annually, plus 50% of my annual contribution up to 6% of my annual salary, so $960 annually. If I am understanding this correctly, they will match me up to $1,280 annually at a maximum. Divide that by 12 months, ($106) and divide that by 2 ($53) since I'm paid semi monthly, and my maximum contribution per paycheck to my 401k should be $53 to receive the maximum match from my company. Doesn't seem like much, 1280 from me, 1280 from them, is 2560 per year. After 20 years if I retire that early, (I'm 24 so that's probably not realistic, not at this rate at least!) that's only 51k I've put back for retirement, if I'm even understanding this correctly! lol.

I can include other parts of the FAQ if all the necessary information isn't present.
Would really appreciate any clarification on this subject for my understanding. I asked my HR person directly what my contribution should be so as to receive the maximum match from our company, but she referred me to their FAQ on paycom, for legal reasons, I assume she's not allowed to counsel me on this subject, or she just didn't feel like it lol. Please let me know if I can provide more information from somewhere on my company's documents page if need be.

Btw, I currently have $40 per check going into my 401k, and $40 into a Roth IRA. I really had no understanding when setting this up, and still don't really. Just figured I shouldn't put all my eggs in one basked lol. Hopefully that was an effective, if simple solution, to a complex problem I don't fully understand.

Would gladly appreciate any input!

Edit: After checking the PF FAQ, I see that 10% is typically recommended, I have heard that before. Just wanting to make sure I am reaping the maximum match from my company, and just curious if based on the language in the FAQ, it is a good company to work for long term or not. 1% of 100% sounds like, but 50% of 6% doesn't sound so bad I guess. Maybe I'll go from $40 to $100 if they match that much? But then maybe drop the Roth IRA? Or double up and put $100 in both per check?! My draw at the end of the month will be pretty thin! lol. Lots of moving parts here! Too many for my understanding anyways. Thanks again in advance for any responses.

Post PF FAQ Edit: After reading the rest of the FAQ, it sounds like I can put as much as I want into a 401K/Roth, up to 19k for the 401k at least and 6k for the Roth, disregarding contributions. It's up to each person, where they see themselves in the future, and how much they ready want to save. My main question still stands though:

How much exactly will my company match me based on the language used in their FAQ?

As I understand it, it's 1% of my salary, and half of 6% percent... Or 3% after that 1% is maxed. So $53 per check, assuming I make 32k/year. This would be 2560 per year. Leaving me with only 64k for retirement after 25 years of work. I can save with the Roth too, but they won't match me, they only defer taxes up to 6% of salary. Which is still free money I guess, just savings from Uncle Sam instead of free money from the company. I don't know how toncslculate how much savings in taxes over time that would be, but it's better than nothing I suppose! Additionally, I understand that this shouldn't be the only savings for retirement that someone accumulates over times. Regular deposits into a savings account is probably a good idea, hopefully one that appreciates with interest?",1
t3_bze2w9,How can I maximize my savings?,"I have just about 25k in savings at the moment that I have been building over the last year or two. Right now, its just sitting in my account as an emergency fund. I put a majority of each paycheck into it and I take money out only if I need it for other expenses, or if I want to treat myself to something I really want on occasion. My first goal is to pay off my student loans (\~40k) and right now I just make my monthly payments, plus a little extra. However, I still want to start saving for when I ultimately need to place a down payment on a house when I am ready to buy in the next few years.

&amp;#x200B;

My question for you all, as I am not very experienced in the best way to handle this, is what kinds of things can I do with this money to get the most out of my saving efforts? Investing? CD? Is it smarter to use it to pay off my loans as much as I can now? 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now my mindset is to just save as much as I can each paycheck, pay my monthly payments with a little extra on top, and have at least most of this money in case I need it rather than put all of it into the loans to avoid the interest (which I struggle with knowing if thats a bad idea or not). Is that the wrong way to go about it?

t3_bzlpoe,Best 3yr moderate risk investment?,"Hi!

I have some cash ($50K) that I’d like to keep around for a potential 3 year time horizon to help with downpayment on purchasing real estate. 

I am NOT committed to buying property, it’s just an idea that I’d like to be ready for if the stars align within my timeframe (real estate prices correct somewhat, I have free cash flow to support an affordable mortgage, qualitative considerations, etc). 

I know I can get ~2.5% from a high yield savings account or CD... and I know that long game returns from a stock index fund might be 7%. Since I might need the $ in less than 10 years, a stock index fund is out. 

My question is - how can I invest for a better return than 2.5% but less than 7%?  I’m not interested in a bond fund because as interest rates rise, the value of bonds will fall.  Should I consider individual bonds?  If I buy a portfolio of medium-high credit quality bonds (say, 5 companies at $10K each), I can probably eek out a yield of ~4%/years over 3 years... and by holding to maturity, I remove the risk of capital loss (but not default!). 

REITs are another option, but I think they will be even more volatile on the capital loss front. Are there any other ideas I’m not considering?  Worst case is I sock the $ in a savings account but growth at inflation seems under optimized.",1

t3_bznk5g,Creating a foreign investment plan and understanding its tax implications.,"Hello Reddit.

**Intro**

I've received **$400,000 tax-free**, which I am unsure what to do with. I'm a **24 year-old dual US/EU citizen**, who moved from the US to Europe to do a PhD in AI/machine-learning. I don't plan on returning to the US permanently and I'm a bit weary about keeping money there. How can I invest this money outside of the US? And, should I?

**Lifestyle**

Evidently, I live a pretty frugal lifestyle; I've already been able to save \~$24,000 after 1.5 years on this meager PhD salary, even with extensive backpacking trips. Once the PhD is finished (age 26), I expect to get a research position in Europe, which I expect to pay ≥$110,000. I don't have any debt at all and I have excellent credit.

**Intentions**

I would like to invest this money somewhere and reinvest its returns, as I don't think I'd need this money for quite awhile, but I don't know where to start. I don't have any investment experience, except a $200 investment when I was 19 in a graphite company during Tesla's uprising, whose share prices have gone to $0 (fail). Mainly, I want this money to give me financial independence and security, as well as the possibility to do cool things like buying an AirBNB property in south France.

**Dilemma**

From what I understand, the US tax system is more conducive to making money than within the EU. But at the same time, the US taxes global income (if earning ≥$103,900), potentially hindering my life outside of the US and motivating me to renounce my citizenship in the future. How should I invest in this situation? Perhaps creating an off-shore company is the solution?

t3_bznj4d,Deciding when to divest from a former employer's bullet train stock,"**TL;DR** Got lucky with a startup whose stock has performed extremely well, but now assets asset allocation is heavily indexed in that former employer's stock. Divest now and accept later and possibly less comfortable retirement, or keep waiting with fingers crossed for 4-5x growth over the next... 5-10 years?

&amp;#x200B;

**Okay,** I got super lucky (extreme understatement) getting hired at an early stage startup about 5 years ago. On top of winding up with a higher salary than I'd ever imagined (which my spending quickly grew in to) the company's stocks have gone on to do extremely well. The current value of the shares is nearly 200x what it was when I started, leaving me with about $3.2M worth of RSUs and now-exercised ISOs.

I plan on selling the RSUs to pay off debt, take a break from work, and get some professional training for when I get back into the job market (in 6-10 months).

This leaves the shares from the options remaining, currently worth about $3.1M on their own. I exercised the options this year, and will owe a large amount in AMT taxes next year, as I don't plan on selling any of the stocks acquired via the ISO exercise this year, (though at tax time next year I'll need to liquidate some to pay taxes). Depending on how the stock performs between now and then, this could mean selling anywhere between \~10-20% those holdings to cover taxes (which I hope to be able to reclaim via AMT credit during subsequent years). This leaves \~$2.5-2.8M at today's valuation. I realize this *could* be enough for a more frugal person to retire, but it would be less than I took home while I was working, and definitely wouldn't be enough for *both* my girlfriend and I to retire.

My gf and I have decided that an ideal retirement salary would be \~$240k/year. I realize this is an obscene level of spending, but we're talking best case scenario (which would allow for purchasing a nice home in CA, having a nice car for each of us, being able to travel whenever we want, and being able to help out our families when needed,) and we could obviously make do with less. We currently spend about $100k/year renting a small, decent condo in CA, traveling when we're able to, and living relatively comfortably. 

By my calculations, following the 3% withdrawal rule, and assuming a 20% average tax rate on our investments, we'd need \~$10-12M to maintain that kind of lifestyle, or roughly 4-5x what we have now.

The question is, should I leave the shares be, as I'm reasonably comfortable in the company's potential for growth over the next 5 years? Or should I be less irresponsible with this incredible opportunity I've been given, and divest from that stock in a quick but tax favorable way, accepting that this will mean a later retirement?",1

Someone else would be a trainer alongside me, but that part of their role is secondary, and they have been mainly handling it while the job has been open. Once I get situated, that would not be a big part of their role anymore. I would also have to help one-on-one if needed.

Glassdoor seems to give me a rough estimate of 55k/year for a position like this. Since I live somewhere cheap and I'm young, I do not expect to receive that amount, but the firm is pretty big. I was offered 40k a year with the standard  office-type job of 15 days a year PTO (that has the sick leave built-in).

Should I present a counteroffer? If so, how can I do so while remaining firm yet still making sure they don't rescind the offer entirely? Am I just looking up the wrong types of jobs... Or am I expecting too much (etc etc). Everyone I've met has seemed great to work with, and I know someone else in the company who has nothing but high praise of the culture, especially in IT. I want this job regardless of whether I get more pay, but I also want to make this as fair as I can and receive the most I can, all things considered.

If I were in a stable role as it is, I would be happy to counteroffer and decline if it wasn't accepted. The issue is that I left my previous regional supervisor role (of admin and clerical) of a large insurance company to move back to my home state with a job that I thought would be a good fit. It turned out terribly, and I left very quickly, but I thought I would bounce back quickly with a good job, which clearly didn't happen. I wouldn't have left if it weren't so terrible that I found working two retail jobs years ago to make ends meet was better. Should I just accept so I don't up risking continuing my current situation, or should I push for a little bit more from them?

I was thinking 45k a year with 18 PTO days a year.

Thanks again!

I'm hoping someone can help me feel better about where our money is going when we pay our mortgage every month.

According to a statement we get every month, when we pay the ~$2,800 bill every month about $500 goes to principal, $1000 to interest and ~$1300 to escrow.

t3_bzknca,Expensive medical bill for minimal help.,"I'll try to make this short but to the point.

Essentially, I had severe tooth pain back in February that later needed a root canal procedure. However I had to wait around a week before they would take me due to scheduling. I've tried to cope with the pain, however I've lost almost all nights of sleep and its affected my work at a new job as well. One day a snow storm hit my area, and as luck would have it, a patient cancelled their appointment and my dentist was able to do my procedure that day.

However the main issue is from the night before. The pain was multiplied insanely that night for an odd reason and it was driving me crazy, to the point I asked my brother to take me to the hospital at around 3 AM in desperate hopes they'd at least put me on something to dull the pain. It was to the point I was shivering and almost hysterical with how much this pulsing pain was affecting me, coupled with very few hours of sleep, it was difficult to give them my information. They eventually take me to the ER to which I'm there for around 40 minutes before told to leave.

The ""procedure"" was apparently a dental block, however the physician barely injected me with the chemical, merely spraying it in my mouth, around 3/4ths of the syringe, so now I'm subjected to an awful taste in my mouth that will do absolutely nothing, before finally injecting me with it. The numbness lasted around 40 minutes, while short, I was in bliss the pain was finally gone. And then extremely miffed it had returned half way home.

However receiving the bill today marks me at $721.70, with none deducted. I'm certain my insurance plan should have covered **something**. Not to mention being asked to pay this extreme amount for next to nothing in terms of help, is there anyway I can dispute this? Or at most pay less?",1

## Digging into the 5-year rule

That seems fairly straightforward. However, what most people might not realize is that when you rollover a Roth 401(k) to a Roth IRA, the clock is reset. And in this case, it's the timing of the Roth IRA that counts.

For example, let's say you've had a Roth 401(k) for 10 years and you've also had a Roth IRA for five years. If you roll your Roth 401(k) into your Roth IRA, there's no problem. You've met the 5-year rule. But now let's say you've only had your Roth IRA for 3 years. Even though your Roth 401(k) meets the 5-year rule and then some, if you roll it into your 3-year-old Roth IRA, you'd have to wait another two years before you could withdraw earnings tax-free (although, as with any Roth account, you could withdraw your contributions tax-free at any time).

So to answer your first question, yes, it could make sense to open a Roth IRA at least five years before you plan to rollover your Roth 401(k). **However, it's not enough to open it. You have to make a contribution for the 5-year time period to start**. The problem is that not everyone is eligible to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

## Rollovers Don’t Count Against Limits

If you have money in other qualified retirement accounts, such as a traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b) or even another Roth IRA, you’re allowed to move the money to a Roth IRA. ***These rollovers don’t count as contributions,*** so they don’t reduce the amount that you can contribute each year. For example, if you roll over $15,000 from another qualified retirement plan to a Roth IRA, you can still make your annual contribution to your Roth IRA.",1

I have a general question regarding rental car insurance, because for some reason I cannot find the answer online. Sorry if I am posting in the wrong sub.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to go on a vacation with few of my friends and we want to list all of us as additional drivers for our rental car as we will be driving extensively (and no surcharge in CA). However, the issue is with the insurance - our individual auto policy and/or credit card insurance will only extend the coverage to rental car/driver only if the individual is the ""renter"". This means the other additional drivers are not and will not be covered by their individual auto policies regardless of being listed as the additional driver; unless you purchase additional insurance from the rental car company.

t3_bzdyke,Advice needed on buying both a new home and a new vehicle possibly,"First time posting this sub and Hope not breaking  any rules.

Background:

FL, USA

26 year old male working full time as a staff RN (3. 12hr shift/week) base pay $25.18/hr but also receive $54 per paycheck based on certifications. Hoping to add another certification by this fall that would double the $54. 

I put 12% off the top every paycheck into the company/hospitals 403B retirement plan pretax automatically . Because I invest this much after I am vested ( three years of working for the company) I will receive the maximum amount of employer contribution matching which is 4% giving my total retirement plan 16% of my income. I have currently worked there for 2.5 years so only until next January before I receive the vesting and thus the match.

In addition to this for the 2.5 years I’ve been there I have typically worked an extra shift or two most every week.

I am on the hospital/companies health insurance plan and the minimum coverage based on my age and being in shape and my lack of need to go to the doctor which cost me about $60 bucks a month straight from my paycheck.

I currently live with very little overhead staying at my folks house and commuting to work driving a crappy 175,000 mile 2003 Toyota corolla that requires minimal maintenance, knock on wood, at this time.

I Was fortunate enough to graduate with my bachelors in nursing with zero student loans as well as starting out with about $10,000 in personal savings that over these last 2 1/2 years has grown to approximately $85,000 which I keep in a capital one savings account that receives 2% interest. 

This past winter 2019 I started a Roth IRA contributing the max match for both 2018 and 2019 so that has approximately $12,000 in it. Plus with my financial advisor I have a long-term/retirement type account with approximately $6000 in it. 


I am unfortunately single and never been married and no kids. Lol Bad for happiness but good for my finance I guess.


I recently learned of a program through a friend for a nurse practitioner Masters level degree but I cannot start it until fall 2020 related to having missed the application for this coming fall that was this last spring. This program is offered with government grants that will essentially make a zero cost to me. I am Sure there are some lab/equipment/textbook fees but the large part of it education wise and cost is free through grants.  


I would very much like to invest in a new vehicle in the near future most likely a truck specifically a Toyota Tacoma with a nicer package and some upgrades. Conservatively calling this a $40,000 expense. I’ve seen what I desire available for around 36-37,000 but like I said let’s conservatively say 40,000. 


My financial advisor is very conservative and has never  splurged on vehicles himself so he says this is dumb but the same time he said he’s not going to argue me on it because for my age and work ethic I have enough saved up and knows I can always work hard to make more. 


I also would very much like to move out of my folks again and renting just does not seem to make sense and most everyone I’ve talk to agrees I’m better off buying a modest home which I could always rent or sell. 

My folks think an appropriate price range for a home closer to where I work would be 100,000 to 250,000 and could go as high as 275,000 range-ish as long as I could negotiate down closer to 250,000. 


I would much prefer not to spend all of my savings because there is comfort in having a decent savings in case of emergency‘s or any kind of unknown problems that could arise in the future but is it wise or OK to buy both a new car and a home given my circumstances and financial situation? Does this housing price range seem appropriate?",1

t3_bz1k49,Gf moving into my place soon. Is it wise to write a contract for monthly expenses?,"I own my condo and keep up with all my expenses, including student loan repayments. Slowly paying down my CC debt. All in all, while it’s nowhere near as fast as I would like, I’m doing ok and making progress.

My girlfriend of almost a year is moving in with me in the next couple months. She’s already been staying at my place for most of the week, we’re just waiting for her lease to end. We’ve had some great conversations about the expenses, splitting my mortgage payments, utilities, etc etc. We even got under $200 a month for groceries! We have not started the major payments, though, since she’s still shelling out rent on her apartment. 

My question is, should I try to get some sort of contract figured out with her before she formerly moves in, with a breakdown of what we agree to? Eg., the mortgage, internet, utilities, groceries, etc? On the one hand, I can’t imagine significant others enjoy having that conversation. On the other, I’ve heard too many “Judge Judy” level horror stories to just blow it off. May also X post in relationship advice.

TLDR: Should I draft a contract with my gf before she moves into my condo? What should be included in the contract, and how would you approach it with an SO?

Virginia, if that makes a difference.

UPDATE #1 : Holy crap this got more traction than I was expecting. I can’t keep up with the replies, so I’ll try to summarize some issues here;

Communication: thanks to everyone that mentioned this one! We’re both social workers, so it always comes back to communication, anyways. 

Trust: I want to be clear, I have no questions about trusting her. I really am inexperienced with roommates and splitting expenses. I have no idea what the prevailing wisdom is, but got a boatload here!

Equity: Excellent point! I hadn’t considered how much I would benefit from that, versus her monthly decrease in “rent” payments. This’ll be the place to start in future conversations.

To everyone that’s chiming in here or the other post, thank you! Even (especially?) the more angry/offended contributors. You’ve done a hell of a job on driving home the magnitude of the potential consequences, whatever decision is made.

To be clear, my wording sucked, and she’s not actually paying my mortgage, nor are we combining finances. What we had agreed to was a fixed amount per month which includes half the utilities, internet, HOA, and mortgage equivalent. That mortgage sum will change, for sure. That total amount is still $200 less than her current rent. I’m not looking to profit from this arrangement. I’m just psyched up that we get to do this together, and benefit together. She falls asleep next to me in 5 minutes flat. I can’t put a dollar value on that, and don’t want to disrupt it, either.

Update #2: we had a great conversation last night after I reviewed most of the feedback here. FWIW, the heart of it was our mutual nervousness. She’s unconcerned about the finances, since we’re both making our individual obligations, and still wants to contribute a sizable chunk towards me being able to get a better working car. Lots of trust, and communication, followed by a good night’s rest. The “rent” amount will likely change, since I’m going to address the equity issue at a later date. We’ll do the math, come up with a monthly budget, and I’ll send that through email. It won’t happen for a couple months still, so we’ll work out the nerves between now and then and recap periodically.",1
t3_bzmdwq,How to invest non retirement disposable income so it can be withdrawn. A better title might be how to buy stock? (not which ones),"I read the old personal finance redit page and have a question (at end)

I want the ability to withdraw my investments for things such as big home improvements, buying a new car, buying a new house if needed. 

Current family budget has us saving roughly 30%, can be higher depending on how big the *wants portion* of the expenses is this month. We're currently set up for 45% needs, 30% savings 25% wants but we through a few of the wants such as tv, eating out a concert once a month into the needs sections. 

The 30% is kinda being split up by: 15% retirement, 5% vacation, 10% projects and such

We also have 8% pre tax to 401k to with 4% company match and a pension from one employer. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is how do we invest each? 

* **Retirement** \- max out 401ks and an IRA for the tax benefits seems like the most logical choice. The current 401ks are at 15% and 13% return for 12 months
* **Vacation/Projects -** I understand the ideas behind a high yield savings account and CDs but I feel like we can up our risk tolerance with these funds. So how do set up an account to buy/sell stocks or is this where a financial advisor comes into play? Seeing how the 401ks are doing and knowing that even with recessions your probably better off in the market it feels like the stock market or an indexed or mutual fund makes the best sense I just don't know how to go about becoming invested in one. The dream scenario is these funds make 8% or so and we can withdraw them without the whole loan from a 401k type thing.

One of the other engineers is the same age as me, has less relative experience than me, and only has an associate's degree, while I have a bachelor's degree. He started about 5 months before me, but that's the only thing he has on me credential wise. We've both been very open with each other about our compensation, and from that I've learned that he's making $25/hr. 

I'm salary and don't get payed for my overtime, while he gets 1.5x pay for every hour over 40hrs. I wouldn't think anything of this, if it weren't for the fact that even as salary, I'm expected to work a minimum of 46 hrs a week. He is too. So that's 6 hrs ( at least) every week that he's getting payed for, and I'm not. Aside from that, we both get the same benefits, same bonuses, etc. 

I should also note that during my one year review, I was told by my manager that he was really impressed with my work, and that I scored really well on the review. I pressed several times for him to comment on anything that he would like to see me improve on in the next year, and he couldn't give me anything other than, ""keep it up.""

t3_bzjqb4,Made bad financial choices with school loans when I was younger. How to make it back from some of those mistakes.,"I have been looking around this sub looking for something similar to my situation and having some trouble. If you can point me to a thread that might help or have any information that could help me would be great. 

I am 26 now and took out some school loans when I was 18 and trying to get into a community college. I got about 3000 dollars in loans, used it all and then got really anxious of how to pay it back. I ignored it till I was about 22 and by then the loans had doubled if not a bit more because of interest. Since then I made a new payment plan and have paid back almost the original 3000 dollars i owed but still have about 4000 to go. Is there anyone I can call to try to ask for loan forgiveness or beat that interest rate I am getting or is refinancing on that amount worth it? The debt is through Navient. It is two separate debts and currently paying more then the lowest amount they were asking for. Any advice for a guy just trying to get back on track before trying to get into a bigger loan such as a car or home loan?",1

t3_bzfcng,Received phone call about medical bill for our son from someone claiming to be from the medical provider.,"My husband received a call from someone while he was at work claiming to be from the billing department of the ambulance service company that transferred our son during a medical emergency back in January. Thing is, my husband is a paramedic for said company and didn't recognize him. However, my husband admits he probably doesn't know all the staff. 

He said the only thing he gave the person over the phone was our son's DOB. And he said he was currently on a call and could not talk but would call him at a later time. The person provided a contact number.

Then my husband called me and told me all this.

So I directly called my husband's employer and spoke to the billing department. She said she didn't recognize the number that the person gave my husband. The reason this is all weird is that our son DOES have a bill due, but we have still not received any paperwork about it because he was doubly-insured at the time and things are going back and forth between the provider and both insurances right now. 

I'm worried about the call my husband initially received. Is there some explanation for this person having called him, if it was a scam, and what could they do with our son's name and DOB? I'm under the impression children don't have credit reports (he's 4 years old). Is there anything else I should do? I don't think this person would have that information unless they really worked there, but I can't be sure. My husband didn't get a name, I think.

I told my husband not to give out any personal information over the phone and he agreed that's a good rule.",1

t3_bzlwjd,Move Back Home or Stay,"I'm trying to decide whether to move back home to pay off my credit card debt or to stay where I currently live.

I owe about $9k in credit card debt at 19.99% and make approximately $3k per month after taxes. My monthly bills (excluding groceries and credit card repayment) is about $2k.

If I choose to stay, my partner is willing to pay part of my rent to live with me part-time, helping to reduce my expenses to approximately $1,600 but it would take me just under 2 years to pay it off fully.

On the other hand, moving back to my parents place, I'd be able to pay off my debt in about 5 months and save a little bit of cash. The downside is that my daily commute will become 2 hours (vs. my short walk to the office), wouldn't be able to have my partner stay over (therefore more money spent on dates and airbnbs), and live in a somewhat toxic family environment.

Is approximately 6 months of living back with my parents worth it? Or should I try to live on a stricter budget for the next 2 years?",1
t3_bzlw0r,Healthcare Options,"I appreciate reading this sub, which helped me go from piling up credit debt to budgeting and paying it down at a healthy pace, so I thought I’d finally post. I’m in a bad but probably common position where I make too much to qualify for subsided health insurance in the US, but too little to afford it. 

Monthly situation:
Rent: 850 (I live in NYC, so this is about as cheap as it gets)
Utilities (including cell): 150
Business expenses (software subscriptions and supplies for my freelance business): 300
Groceries: 200-300
Minimum credit card payments: 800
Minimum student loan payments: 1200
Public transportation: $125-400 (I need a train pass and subway pass during months I  work outside the city, otherwise it’s just the subway pass)

So that’s around $4000 in expenses, mostly debt. My take-home pay is a minimum of $4000 thanks to a steady booking, but often 5-6k when I book better paying or extra gigs (I’m freelance). Right now I’m following my accountant’s advice and paying off my credit card with any extra money before I start contributing to my retirement account or building my savings beyond my current $5k buffer. I have zero health insurance and a long-term, painful health problem has been getting worse. My plan was to put off getting insurance for two more years so I can pay off most of my debt, then use my extra money to get insurance and handle my health problems, but they’re starting to get too painful to ignore. I’ve tried keeping it at bay with a healthy diet and exercise, but pretty sure I need to start consulting specialists. 

The cheapest plans I found were Oscar. The plans that have lower copays/$600 deductibles are $850/mo, which eats up my minimum credit card payment even before I factor in an estimated $200/mo in copays (based on past treatments), while catastrophic insurance is around $450/mo with a $7000 deductible. During good months I could afford this but it would considerably slow my debt payoff plan, during bad months I would have to give up on paying anything on my credit cards at all. 


Are there any options for healthcare that would cover long-term physical therapy/treatments/surgery? Not sure where I should even be looking, so I have just been googling around. Or is this sort of premium my only option and I have to choose between potential bankruptcy and severe pain?",1

t3_bzlv32,I don't want to live paycheck to paycheck anymore. I really need your help. (UAE),"Hi,

Hope everybody is well.

I am an European expat who has been living the United Arab Emirates for the past 3 years. This country is labeled as a great place to temporarily gain work experience and put some money on the side due to the fact that the government does not retain any tax from your salary. There is, however, a VAT of 5% that is applied on consumer goods and certain services that was introduced in January 2018 if I recall. People come here to work, save money and then go back to their home country. However, this perceived opulence comes with a sort of heightened commercial hedonism. The amount of ways that this country, and especially Dubai, is offering to spend and overspend your money is staggering. But I think that's only natural, that's what they built here and that's their identity. 

I want to change that.

I am 25 years old, medium-level digital marketer working in an international corporation. I am currently on my second job. My monthly salary for the first 2 years was **AED 10,000 ($2,722)**. Twelve months ago I found a better position that pays better **AED 15,000 ($4,083)** which has made my life easier. 

Needless to say, I am leaving paycheck to paycheck for a reason or another. I've scouted the market, I did research into the financial expectations of my position and I can say that I am earning good money. I am not being underpaid for my position and experience but I cannot seem to neither cope nor come to terms with the financial pressure that Dubai is placing on me. 

The situation is the following.

Dubai is a credit card haven. Therefore, I own one credit card, alongside the debit card on which my salary gets transfered. I also have a 2nd debit card for alleged savings - I usually transfer there the upcoming rent money so that they do not sit on the main debit card.

My main spending card is the credit card and, at the end of the month I transfer money from the debit card to pay the credit card. It's not a big deal because I am making some points that I can redeem but realistically I cannot go back on only using the debit card because it's a vicious circle. Next month I would have to pay the credit card bill and still use the same amount of money for a full month from the debit card in order to change the way I do things. I always try to spend on the credit a certain amount of money that I am sure I will always be able to pay back. (more or less).

My credit card bill always comes on the 21st of the month which counts as the first day of my spending cycle. My salary pay day is 25th of the month. Please find a summary below.

**Debit Card Spends - commences immediately on the salary day**

* AED 3200 ($871) - Monthly rent (gets transfered immediately on the 2nd Debit card. The rent is being paid quarterly so I am dividing the quarterly sum into 4 and save every month)
* AED 1500 ($408) (Bank Loan (I took out a loan approx. 2 years ago which helped me move out from the place I was living in at that time - sharing with other people - into a rented studio. I also purchased a medium priced motorcycle as a mode of transportation - I still have 2 years left on the loan with a remaining amount of AED 40,156) - The monthly amount is fixed. 
* AED 720 ($196) (University Loan - self explanatory. Remaining amount: approx AED 140,000) - The monthly amount that I pay on a monthly basis depends on my salary. Every time my salary increases the monthly payment. I am not in a hurry to pay for this because it's on a 24 year duration. Furthermore, if I don't have a job I don't have to pay. It's dormant in the background and I am not working towards paying it faster because it is not in my interest not it is a priority at the moment.
* AED 2000 ($545) (on average, I send money home to my parents. Not every month but every other month) - This cannot be removed from here as it is as important as paying rent. The amount can change though.
* AED TBC Credit Card Bill) - Please see below for Credit Card breakdown and details

* **TOTAL** AED 7,420 ($2,020) - Remaining: 7,580 ($2,063)

**Credit Card Spends - every cycle starts on the 21st of the mont (bill is due on the 15th of the next month**

* AED 1,200 ($327) - Mandatory Monthly Installment (I stupidly overspent in December 2018 due to travelling and just splurging on a vacation with my parents which resulted in a surplus of AED 12,000 which I was unable to pay. I divided it into installments for the full year of 2019. This ends in December). This amount gets added automatically to my credit card bill on the 21st of the month.
* AED 1,200 ($327) - Bills and Subscriptions (these amount to the following categories: Google One (2TB), Phone Bill, Home TV &amp; Internet, Water &amp; Electricity, Spotify, Netflix and Maid). The monthly amounts that I pay on these services are the following:

Google One (2TB) - AED 39 ($11)
Phone Bill - AED 223 ($61)
Home TV &amp; Internet - AED 399 ($109)
Water &amp; Electricity - AED 300 ($82)
Spotify - AED 20 ($5.4)
Netflix - AED 43 ($12)
Maid - AED 180 ($49)

Now, I am trying to get better and spend more consciously so this month will look a bit better in the breakdown. The May Credit Card Bill was AED 7,800 ($2,124) out of which AED 1,200 ($327) was on takeaway (ridiculous). I paid that from the Debit and I deducted the AED 5,420 ($1,476) as per the above and I had a remaining of AED 1,800 ($490) which I had to spent on my bike because I had a flat tire and it needed a service. 

This month credit card breakdown spends with 9 days left in the paying cycle (until the 21st) is the following:

* AED 1000 ($272) - Bills
* AED 103  ($28)- Cat supplies
* AED 1078 ($294) - Groceries
* AED 346  ($94) - Take Away
* AED 647 ($176) - Motorcycle maintenance / gasoline (this amount is usually very low as gas is very cheap here. However I had a few problems with her in the past few months, that's it. Usually I spent AED 35 / week for gasoline, making it approx AED 140 a month)
* AED 610 ($166) - Going Out / Entertainment
* AED 224 ($61) - Miscellaneous 
* AED 513 ($140) - Travel (I bought a plane ticket to go home but I used points from my credit card. The residual amount left that I had to pay was AED 513).

TOTAL: AED 4,008 ($1,091) (with 9 days left in the paying cicle)
Installment: AED 1,200 ($327)

Grand Total as of now: AED 5,208 ($1,417)

This credit card bill is a massive improvement though. I currently have 2.7K less than last month.

The idea is, as you can see that I am remaining at the end of the month with not much and I want to have an emergency fund, a travel fund and to live a bit comfortably. I am improving month-on-month but how can I optimize to do better?

What can I do in this regard?

t3_bzjh07,"Help Understanding Credit Report, Delinquencies and Next Steps","Hello everyone,

I am posting here, mainly because I don't really have the support around me to answer these questions, and I never had this stuff explained to me growing up.

I am 23 years old, and for the first time in my life checked my credit score! It is a whopping 560, with a few things that scared me. Under my credit score, it said I have the following:

30 Days Late: 1
60 Days Late: 1
90 Days Late: 3
Derogatory: 45

Even in the context of my credit report, I don't really know what these things mean. There was some information below, where it stated my current apartment and rent, and that I paid on time and was satisfactory, and then below that, it has 2 other items, one from HP Sears and one from Jefferson Capital Systems, which I googled and they look like collection agencies.

From here, I have absolutely no idea what to do. Between the 2, it's a total of $800, and for the life of me, I have no idea what those are in reference too. One is dating back to this time last year, and the other is from 2016. I got my first ever credit card this year, and haven't missed any payments, and have never been late on rent before.

So, as a total PF rookie, I don't know what to do. I just applied for a new apartment, am I not going to get it because of this credit score? How do I pay this stuff off? I have the money to pay it outright, but is that what I'm supposed to do? Is it possible for me to find out what the charges are for, and what to do next?

I got a notice on my TransUnion credit monitoring that my mortgage company reported me as delinquent on 6/7. All my payments have been made on time so I pulled my credit report. It lists my mortgage as paid up to date, however there is a second listing for an identical mortgage that was opened 2/14 and closed 2/22. 2/14 was the date we closed on our house.

The terms on the delinquent duplicate list $0 per month for 360 months and that I'm over 60 days delinquent. Last payment made 2/19/2019 for $0. I can add a screenshot for clarity if necessary. This obviously has tanked my credit.

I called my mortgage company and they won't give me any information via phone. I have to write them a letter. I plan on disputing this with TransUnion, however I have a few questions:

1. Should I send a letter to mortgage company asking for details or just straight up dispute it with them?

2. I tried pulling Experian and Equifax online but bungled my security questions somehow. Can I start a dispute with TransUnion while I wait for a paper copy of the other two reports? Or should I wait and do all 3 at once?

3. What do I say in the letters to my mortgage company and the credit bureaus? I'm at a loss on how to word these.

t3_bzhikg,Lab Work Bill Whoops,"Hi all! First post on r/PersonalFinance so the shellacking I receive should be fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not long ago I went to the doctor after a very brief STD scare, and realized I had never had a full panel test run, something a 26 year old man likely should have under his belt. 

At the doctor's office, he explained to me they don't do bloodwork in office so he'd order labwork done. I asked him to approximate the cost, and he said insurance would cover it. He handed me a pamphlet with the lab location and I was on my way there about 5 minutes later. 

Fast forward to yesterday when I received the statement from my insurance explaining I owed $650 for the tests. This is where the ""whoops"" portion of the title comes in. I realize that in my haste, I listened to the doctor and didn't check with my insurance to see whether there are any qualifications for lab work, etc. Evidently, my insurance only covers lab work done by independent labs, not labs affiliated with hospitals (which is where I was told to go). 

I called my insurance but they basically told me ""nah, we're not going to cover it.""

Now, understanding (and therefore not needing to be told) that this was 100% my fault for not checking, does anyone have any additional advice on anything I can do to reduce this cost? I am (clearly) pretty uninitiated to the world of insurance and how these things work, so any advice is nice. 

If I'm out of options (which I suspect is the case) then I'm fine to eat that cost, I'd just prefer not to since I had set aside some money for an upcoming trip I'm taking in June.

I can’t afford to quit financially and I’m banking on this web developer internship to carry me into the next opportunity.  However I’m also running myself into the ground, I cant be happy in the relationship working and commuting this much. I’m not sure I even like him that much anymore.

t3_bzg0jb,What's the best way to pay down my credit card balance?,"Hi all. Sorry if this is a cliche question.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently owe $1,900 on my credit card. I don't really use my card all that much, mostly for unexpected big expenses. The main chunk of the amount that's currently on it was from an emergency procedure my cat had to have done.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for some advice. I don't have enough to pay off the statement balance this month. My internet bill ($60) and pet insurance ($45) are linked to my credit card. I'm wondering what the best way to get this balance paid down would be. Should I make multiple payments in a month when I'm able to, or save and make a large payment each month? Does it matter?

I know this balance isn't super high but it's giving me anxiety and I've been racking up interest. Any advice would be really appreciated!",1
t3_bzh6vn,What should I do next to secure a credit card?,"So after some disastrous life circumstances that led me to get into a lot of debt that went to collections, I finally paid it all off after 2 years of dedication.  All I have left is my student loans, which I have never missed a payment on.  My credit score went from the 400's to 670.  Still not great, but I figured maybe I could get a credit card.  

In those 2 years, I had gotten turned down every time due to good reason, so the only one I was able to get was a secured card from a local credit union because I could plead my case in person with somebody I knew.  

Now my credit score is 100 points higher than that, I have started applying for the worst of the credit cards.  Yearly fees, secured cards, high interest rate, super low limits.  I figured I would have a chance, but I don't.  All said I had too low of income (I make 50k per year so that was odd) or that I had too many collections (most don't go off my record until about 2023).

t3_bzkz8i,How to divide savings between IRA and Brokerage,"Low income, low spending, self-employed 31y old. 
For general use and retirement, I invested about 100K in $VT last October. I have 15K cash in savings &amp; checking account.

Would love you guys's advice on how to proceed in the coming years.

The 100K is divided: 10% Roth IRA, 90% brokerage account.

My original plan was to keep funding the Roth IRA every year with by doing max contribution, hopefully almost never running the brokerage account dry, but recently I realized this is not a smart plan, because if I want access to that money at any time in the next 28 years, I would eat a 10% penalty PLUS pay general income tax on it.

On the other hand, I pay taxes over all dividends (~2% / year) that are being awarded in the brokerage account, and I'm sure that adds up in the long run.

Currently I'm thinking of taking the following approach, and I'd love your opinion on it. I will convert 2K per year from my (long-term gains) brokerage to the IRA until I amm 59.5 years old. This way, I can still make use of the Roth IRA Saver's Tax Credit (I make less than 18k) every year AND I keep enough money at hand, in case of a house down payment or a big purchase, like a car.

What do you think?",1
t3_bzh0ww,Preparing for when the cancer comes back,"I’m a divorced parent who provides nearly sole care and has primary custody of a 7 year old. 

Last year I was diagnosed with stage 1A breast cancer. Had a single mastectomy.
Cancer free now for about 9 months. 

I am lucky enough not to have debt from it. I had insurance at the time and was able to apply for some financial assistance programs through the cancer center and the hospital to help wipe out my $5000 deductible. 

I now have only a $1500 deductible which is the cheapest my workplace insurance offers.

I am poor. Well, I make $30,000 a year but bring home roughly $22,000 after taxes and health insurance/ dental. 

I have a profit sharing plan that sits at $30,000. I have roughly $5000 in savings and get $450 a month from my ex husband but it isn’t always consistent. 

I pay for all the expenses for me and my child and have zero debt. 

I can’t get affordable life insurance thanks to my health. I had a plan before my surgery but the surgeon demanded up front payment and I had to make a choice to pay him or don’t have the surgery. I couldn’t cut the lights or the rent so the insurance had to go. I also lowered my car insurance premium by adjusting my limits and paid my utility bills late.  He wanted over what my credit limit was. It was a stupid choice but it was the only bill that wasn’t necessary and I needed the surgery and the immediate follow up care had copays. 

 I was priced recently at nearly $200 a month which is just something I can’t afford. I could afford maybe $30 a month and my old policy wasn’t even $30, it was $50. 

I am struggling, as in just barely making, payments on everything. 

Follow up care is expensive and my child has epilepsy so together the copays are just ridiculous. He has state Medicaid (I have workplace insurance) but because I make above a certain amount we have deductibles. I am suppose to have a screening every month and a mammogram and ultrasound every six months. But I can’t afford the copays right now every time so I am trying to stagger them more. 

After monthly expense I am able to have $25 at the end of the month to contribute to savings. 

Is there anything I can do with that $25 and maybe the $5,000 to turn it into more money? 

I work full time and my ex husband only sees our son 6 hours a week so getting a second job is going to take child care costs I don’t have. 

My cancer may come back, they said. I am at risk and they keep telling me how important follow up care is. How important the screenings are but they cost so much. The next time it might be more aggressive and I am just trying to find a way to afford it when it does. 

Break down on my expenses: 

$880 rent
$150 utilities 
$65 school expenses
$120 copays for follow up care
$108 car and renter insurance 
$40 gas for car monthly 
$250 food and toiletries and house supplies
$450 child care 
$60 medicines 
$25 savings 

I have about $37 usually to “play” with and we usually do stuff with it or buy new clothes or other items. 

It is definitely harder when my ex husband doesn’t send his check consistently.
I have to sometimes tap into savings and then pay myself back. 

I’d love some advice to tackle this. I was considering dropping my health insurance coverage to the lower premium and with a higher deductible like I had last year but I am scared that I won’t be able to get the financial assistance again. Would it be smart to gamble with the lower premium/higher deductible. If they cancer does come back and is more aggressive this time, i’d like to have some money to leave other than what my profit sharing plan will eventually pay out. Or if it is treatable, i’d like to be able to cover the treatment costs. 

I can’t gamble too much with my savings but maybe I could invest it in a way or put it into an account that might yield more. I feel so dumb for letting that life insurance policy go but I am trying to live and feed a child and it was the only give I felt I had. 

I feel like I am only making dumb decisions since the diagnosis and I could use some help.",1
t3_bzkywe,Recent Grad in Unique Financial Position Requesting Retirement Planning Advice,"Decided to create a throwaway to consult Reddit on how those of you that know way more than I would handle their finances in my situation. I have read the “How to handle money” post in the sidebar and have consulted the flowchart graphic already.

My background: I graduated from college in May and was lucky enough to have zero student loans and a job lined up out of college. I will be making a pre-tax income of around \~$82,000-87,000 (think financial services/investment banking) while living in a state that has no state income tax (only federal). I currently have \~$5,000 in a Roth IRA at Edward Jones that I am working on transferring to Vanguard as well as a similar amount in a brokerage account. Because of annoying finance laws, I am not allowed to have any outside brokerage trading accounts so I will have to decide what to do with that money as well. On top of that, I have around $40k in my savings as a result of a death in the family. I am not listing dollar amounts to be a snob, I am only doing so to invite better advice from you all. I completely did not expect this death and wish it never would have happened - no money in the world is worth that to me but it happened. My main question for Reddit is what should I do with my money after considering the retiring benefits available to me from my firm and my individual financial situation.

Retirement benefits:

* 401(k) match of 75% of the first $1,000 and 25% of the second $1000 contributed
* 15% discount employee stock purchase plan not taxable until selling shares; available to purchase quarterly; limited to 1000 shares or $25,000 or 20% of comp. Must hold shares for one-year holding period
* HSA health care plan is offered also with investing ability after 1,000

**TLDR;**

**What should I do with my money?**

**Income: \~$82,000-$87,000 (no state income tax)**

**Assets: $5,000 Roth IRA – $5,000 brokerage trading (have to close soon) – $40,000 savings (including checking account and emergency fund)**

**401(k) match of 75% of the first $1,000 and 25% of the second $1,000 contributed**

**15% discount employee stock purchase plan not taxable until selling shares; available to purchase quarterly; limited to lowest of 1,000 shares or $25,000 or 20% of comp. Must hold shares for a one-year holding period**

t3_bz88ru,I made a huge mistake by taking out a payday loan,"To keep this brief, I had to take out a payday loan to make rent last month. In hindsight, this was a bad idea, as I would've come out WAY cheaper just paying the late fees on my rent. Anyways, I signed up for a payday loan through Speedy Cash for $425. I didn't read the contract before signing (I know, major facepalm) and I've just come to realize that not only will I be paying back $1,309 due to interest, but also an additional one-time payment of $564.26 in principal and CAB fees. $1873.26 for a $425 loan, $119 out of every check I receive for the next 6 months. Is there any way I can lower this? Is there anything I can do at all to avoid repaying such an egregious amount? I know I really messed up by not simply *reading the contract before signing* but surely there's something I can do, right?

EDIT: I want to add that I looked in to refinancing the loan, but the Speedy Cash website is extremely ambiguous. Whenever I go to the refinance tab, I get no information on what my payment amount would be changed to, when my new due date would be, or what my new interest rates would be. The site refuses to give that information until after I have agreed to refinance and paid a fee.",1

I have recently signed a lease for a new toyota 4runner @ $439/month for 3 years with $1500. Not the best deal, I know. Now, A month later, I have cooled off and wish to see if there could be better options. I just called and they say they are open to refinancing the car at around 34k+tax+fee which comes to around $692 for 5 years at 4.92%. The numbers are not exact because no credit check has been done. 

I will be comfortable with the $692 financially, but will it be a better option then the lease? Considering that, I would have paid \~15k with a lease and \~24k with financing with \~15k left (using online amortization schedule) and a resale value of 25k (KBB). So net of \~14k. So in total I would have paid $1000 less for a much higher monthly payment? Am I missing anything? Located in Austin, Tx, if that helps.

t3_bzcdup,Received a failure-to-pay letter from IRS even though I had an installment plan set up. I have spent hours and can't get through to someone on the phone number listed.,"I filed my taxes around end of Feb/beginning of March. I owed around $4300. Set up an installment plan and was given a very vague timeline for when the payments would start ""6-8 weeks after we've processed your return"".

&amp;#x200B;

It said my payments were going to be $60/mo so I kept $60 in the account I entered to pay from.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I got a letter from the IRS saying I'm 2 months late with a failure-to-pay penalty of $43, plus $35 interest. The interest I expected but the failure-to-pay is bullshit. It's dated for 6/15 which is 4 days from now, I don't know how they can take on a failure-to-pay so early..

&amp;#x200B;

I called the 800 number on the letter, spent 20 minutes going through the menus to be told by the automated bullshit 'due to high volume and nature of your request we can't take your call right now' and disconnected.

I've called a few times trying different things but it's not letting me talk to someone.

I don't have $4300 on hand to pay it all off by June 24th (due date on the letter for the whole amount), and now they're not letting me get my installment plan sorted out so I'm not having much of a choice then to just not pay it.

t3_bzktxm,Received insurance collection notice. Seems fishy. Is it a scam?,"I received a letter from CCS Com (Credit Collection Services Commercial) claiming they are trying to recover losses from an auto accident that happened in March. This company's address is in Norwood, MA

The backstory is that I was involved in an accident that was very bizarre because it involved me being blinded by the sun and not being able to prove I was within a marked lane. A driver rear-ended me with a glancing corner blow, but was immediately rear ended by another vehicle behind him. They were in the adjacent lane. Two of us were cited, but I was one because there was no way to prove my exact location. I submitted everything to my insurance, accepted the citation and moved on. I consulted with an attorney and was told that I was likely to lose any case I contested, and that pleading No Contest would be the most costly but safest method. I chose to pay the fine and move on. This accident occurred on March 22, and my own insurance company has already contacted me saying everything was covered in full and that I would not receive any refund, deductible, etc. Essentially, they were agreeing with my citation and saying case closed. I had accident forgiveness enabled, and I've been with this company since 1991 with no prior traffic collisions. It's USAA, and I've found them to be second to none in the history I've been with them. 

Of the other two drivers, one was with another widely recognized big insurance company, who collected my information the same as my own USAA did. I was under the impression that this was the driver who hit me first, and was subsequently hit by the third driver. I gave my statement and have never heard back from them.

Today, I received this collections notice and it seems weird. Here are some pointers I noticed:

1. Why send it to collections before trying to get it from me directly first?
2. It has been less than 90 days since the accident. Why collections so early? Let's assume they HAVE tried to contact me unsuccessfully for the past few weeks. We're still only at day 75 as of the date of the notice.
3. It asks for proof of insurance or payment in full. Why should I have to give my insurance proof to a collection agency? Is that normal?
4. It says it's a subrogation claim. I've had ambulance chasers contact me in the past after visiting doctors for various sports related things like a pulled muscle all asking me to make a subrogation claim against some place where I might've gotten hurt. I always ignored those. Could one of the drivers have actually filed this?
5. I went to their website and the landing page asks you to choose a button, one for a written notice, one for a voice message. Since I always get telemarketing scam calls anymore, sometimes they leave messages along the lines of IRS sending me to collections over unpaid taxes or some other rot. This smacks of that nonsense.
6. The last thing I recall getting from my own insurance was that everything was done, paid in full and case closed. However I do believe there may have been something in there about them not being responsible for any civil suit brought against me. Could this be a precurser to something bigger? 

Essentially I'm wondering if I should take this seriously and contact my insurance company and/or attorney or ignore it completely. I would prefer to let this company know in writing according to the Fair Debt Collections Act that I believe this is a fraudulent case unless it can be determined that this is indeed a legit claim against me. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: minor auto accident less than 3 mos ago. I was partially responsible, paid the citation and had my insurance begin everything I was responsible for. Today, I got a collections notice on behalf of one of the other drivers' insurance co as a subrogation claim. Seems weird that a collections agency would have it so soon when the other insurance company could've come to me directly for any losses my insurance refused to cover. Is this a scam?",1

I'm just trying to find a straight answer to my questions about my retirement plans and it's probably right there but I'm just not seeing it.

My wife is a teacher and will be getting a pension when she retires.

\*Once the max contribution level is reached in a 401K, what happens?  I don't want to lose the 6% I get matched by the company, so with the power of math I'll be increasing my contributions to hit the max by the end of this year.  My math is usually wrong, so I'll probably overpay at some point.

\*Do company contributions count towards the max?

\*Does the $100K inheritance count as income to the IRA deduction at the end of the year?  

\*Is the max per person or is it combined for married folks ($19,000 or $38,000?)

We have kept that there as we thought we would use it as down payment on some land or a house one day. But, now we’re are trying to decide if maybe we should use that money to pay off her student loans and then just make her “student loan payment” back to the savings account. 

Her current student loans are around $700/month and our current house payment is about the same. 

Eventually our goal is to buy around 20 acres of land and build a house. Total payment for that will be around the $1k-$1.2k range. 

I’m new to these type of questions, so forgive me if I’ve left out any vital information or laid this out poorly.",1

t3_bzhzk7,Covered by two health plans: could we end up spending MORE out-of-pocket?,"***The basic situation: I am switching jobs (yay! more money!), and my wife is pregnant (yay! more kids!).***

&amp;#x200B;

***The big question: should my wife be on two healthcare plans?***

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to maximize our value when deciding on healthcare changes this month, since my wife will now be eligible for two plans: one through her current employer, one through my new employer. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I understand it, we could actually end up spending MORE out-of-pocket since we  could potentially be paying toward two deductibles before co-insurance kicks in. Admittedly, final estimates are rough, and I need help on calculating costs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Total family plan (through my new employer, high-deductible with HSA)**

|Deductible (family): $3,000|
|:-|
|Co-insurance: 0% after deductible (0% on inpatient hospital services specifically for estimating birth costs)|
|Out-of-Pocket max (family): $5,000|
|Annual rates totaled: $4,321|

&amp;#x200B;

Under this option, it seems that we could expect to pay anywhere from $7,000 (my rough estimate of annualized rates + birthing cost at hospital) to $9,321 max.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's where I need clarification: my wife is still eligible for her current employer plan, at practically no annual cost.

&amp;#x200B;

**My wife's individual plan**

|Deductible (wife): $1,080|
|:-|
|Co-insurance (wife): 30% after deductible|
|Out-of-Pocket max (wife): $4,388|
|Annual rates totaled: $300|

&amp;#x200B;

***The main question is whether she should be on both plans.***

&amp;#x200B;

Given coordination of benefits, the way I understand this: for upcoming birth, we pay $1,080 out-of-pocket (wife's deductible). Following that, BEFORE co-insurance coverage kicks in on her plan, we would begin paying out-of-pocket toward the family plan deductible of $3,000 (my employer plan). i.e. we would pay $4,080 to cover both deductibles before her 30% co-insurance kicks in (and my 0% would pay the rest). This is all simplified, and doesn't include the new child's healthcare cost obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

***Everything I read online is about how having two health plans can save on large expenses. This seems to be the opposite to me. I feel like I'm greatly misunderstanding something, or we have a unique situation somehow. Wouldn't we be better off declining her employer plan and just using my family plan?***

&amp;#x200B;

For further reading: what I'm leaning toward is the below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Employee (me) + children plan (through my new employer), wife on individual plan**

|Deductible (me + kids): $3,000|Deductible (wife): $1,080|
|:-|:-|
|Co-insurance: 0% after deductible (0% on inpatient hospital services specifically for estimating birth costs)|Co-insurance (wife): 30% after deductible|
|Out-of-Pocket max (me + kids): $5,000|Out-of-Pocket max (wife): $4,388|
|Annual rates totaled: $1,048|Annual rates totaled: $300|

&amp;#x200B;

This seems the most cost effective to me. Sure we have two deductibles, but the annual cost is extremely low, everyone is covered, and the summed out-of-pocket maximum ($9,388) is comparable to potential out-of-pocket max on family plan above. Given the lower deductible on my wife's plan, we could end up spending $3,000 less on her hospital bill.",1
t3_bzhyu0,Should I even have a savings account?,"So for a bit of background, I started working about a year ago. I didn't know too much about what to do with it, so I just did a few basic things: paid off all my loans, set up a 3 months emergency fund in an ally savings account, invested 4% in my 401k. The rest (not much was left because of the loans) went into another savings account.  


Now that my loans have all been paid off, I have more disposable income coming my way and this sub helped me figured out a couple things. I'm now majorly increasing my 401k contributions, almost maxing it out, will be investing in a roth IRA, will strengthen my emergency fund for up to 6 months.  


I still have about $500-1000 left a month after all expenses (including 401k, savings, bills, groceries and what not.) My original plan was to just put it in a savings account, and with my current savings, by the EOY I could have saved up to $15k. My question is, I'm not sure that this savings account has much use, seeing as I'm not really saving for anything. Would I be better off investing this money, or using some of it to fully max out my 401k? I've always grown up with the idea that having a healthy savings account is a must, so I feel a bit unsettled not having one. But then again, I don't want my money to just sit on 2.2% APY.

t3_bys7jk,"If you haven't filed your US Federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by June 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.","Taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. Ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (FTF), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. This penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

If a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the April due date -- or more than 60 days after the October due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. This means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. If the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. The late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

The FTF penalty does not apply to the Taxpayers who met this year’s April 15 deadline to file their individual tax return. It also won’t apply to the Taxpayers who asked the IRS for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by Oct. 15, 2019.

In addition, the IRS urges Taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. The late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (FTP), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. Interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original April 15 deadline.

After a return is filed, the IRS will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. Normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

If you are *claiming a refund* on your federal return and filing late, there is generally no penalty or interest charge.

t3_bzk0at,College Student Confused About Starting Credit Cards/Building Credit,"So I am going into my junior year of college and have now began looking into the future, past my college life. One of the big things is building my credit score. And I have thought that opening a credit card when I am young should do me good down the road. My parents ask me why I want a credit card, I believe they think I won't make my payments on time or go into debt but the reality is that I want to make sure my money is safer from thieves and I want to build credit. I was born into an incredibly lucky situation where my parents pay for my tuition directly and my rent, utilities, and books are reimbursed at the end of each semester - so why not just put all of those on a credit card when I have the cash to repay them immediately and then even reimbursed down the road? I work as a barback during the summer and make a fairly decent amount of cash as a college student (about 10-12k, but officially I only make a few grand - I get tipped out in cash). So I have done some research on credit cards but keep getting confused between all of the thousands of articles about what I should and shouldn't do. My credit score, according to Credit Karma, is 675. I understand I will not qualify for a credit card with all the bells and whistles and it needs to be a fairly simple card. But as I was researching things like ""spend only 30% of your total credit"" came up but then also when searching for student credit cards, things like ""don't worry about only spending 30% of your total credit"" came up too. I have read things that have said to keep credit on your account to build your credit score?? Which I don't fully understand but am presuming that means not paying off your credit card bill on time. Of which I always thought you were supposed to do in order to build credit?!

So I guess my biggest questions are:

1. Is it even a good idea to get a credit card? - I will pay all bills on time, I am sure of that
2. What the hell is the only spend 30% of your credit? 
3. How do I know how much credit I am given? -  I assume it won't be a lot since my official income is low. I have absolutely no knowledge of what I should be expecting, so should I be expecting around $500 or in the thousands range?

What other questions or information should I be aware about with credit cards and building credit? (I do not know what I do not know even exists - assume all I know is that if you pay your bill on time there is no interest or penalty) Any tips or replies would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",1

t3_bzjw91,Opening a new checking account while away from home,"Hi guys! 

I'm having a slight issue setting up a new checking account. My current account is joint with my father, so he can actively monitor my transactions, even though I have graduated college and am working. I applied for a checking account with a new bank, and they requested a social security card. 

The problem is that my father also has my social security card, and I can't request a copy from him because I am doing this without his knowledge. Now, I have considered ordering a new card from the Social Security Administration, but I am out of town for work for the next few months, and I don't want to keep it on me because that doesn't seem very safe. I could wait to open the account when I return, but my parents live nearby, and I am afraid of what they will do if they know I opened the new account. I purposefully tried to open the account while I was out of town for a significant period of time so that everything could blow up while my parents did not have physical access to me. (My father has keys to my apartment and works very close.)

In short, should I order another card now? Or should I just wait until I return? If so, do I just tell the bank to cancel my application?

t3_bzjqxg,Should I pay off my house in 5 years?,"I went through an analysis of my debt and I can be debt free besides my mortgage by the end of this year. That would leave me with $2,300 per month of left over income, not including any raises/bonuses/etc. If I send an extra $1,700 to my principal per month, I can pay off this house in 5 years. 

What I’m having difficulty with is the fact I KNOW this isn’t our forever home. The goal is actually to buy a bigger home in the next 5-10 years. This townhouse was simply bought with the intention to rent it out in the future once I moved on. I would be able to rent this townhouse for $1500 per month. 

What’s the smarter move? Pay this townhouse off in 5 years and save a ton in interest but limit my cash flow. Or simply save the cash for my future home down payment and pay this mortgage like normal as I go along? If I do the latter, I can probably clear $200 per month in cash flow after accounting for capital expenses, repairs, etc.",1
t3_bzjoj6,"HSA to FSA - rollover, investing","Hi all,   


My current employer offers a health insurance plan with an HSA and matches up to $50 per month. I have an HSA account through this employer at Optum Bank with $350 (just opened the account recently). There are no fees, and I believe this is because my employer absorbs them.   


I will be starting a new job in two weeks, and they offer a health insurance plan with an FSA. I don't really understand the difference, except that it seems that FSA funds do not rollover year to year.  


1) Should I keep my HSA? If so, should I move it to a different bank?  
2) I have the means to max out my HSA. Should I do this, or should I at least contribute enough to start investing the HSA funds?  
3) Are there any ""best practices"" I should know about an FSA? For example, after advice seen in this sub I have been paying for my medical expenses out-of-pocket instead of with my HSA. It seems this would be different with an FSA if the balance does not roll over.

t3_bzjknr,Worth refinancing my mortgage? Details inside.,"Background: Mortgage is 10 mos old, 30 year 4.625%. Started at $351k, current balance $344k. Monthly payment is $2,269, but I've consistently been paying $2,500 a month. No plans to move.

Today I get this from my lender:

&gt;Okay, so I backed into a loan amount of $350k to cover the new costs, minus my credit to you of $500.     If we can get the same rate I was seeing today of 3.875%, you are saving $159/month on your mortgage!    That’s $9540 in interest savings just in the next 5 years!!    
 
Basically the math is your estimated payoff, plus costs, less loan amount and my credit equals you need $2357, which represents the new escrow account we have to collect at settlement BUT, your current lender will refund to you the escrow account that they have been building and my estimation is that that amount is probably close to $2800 and therefore what you’d need at closing will be a wash, when you get that refund.   If we start this refi ASAP and settle the first week of July, you can skip July and August and first payment is September.   That’s another $4500 in your pocket!

t3_bzjklc,Trying to make sure I have all my bases covered,"Hi all, I'll try to keep this short and sweet.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year and a half ago I lost my job and was unemployed for six months.  At the time I had three credit cards with outstanding balances on them.  Two months into unemployment, I was flat broke and had no choice but to stop paying them.

When I got back on my feet, I settled with two out of the three, so both are paid off.

The third one is a weird situation.  It's not a traditional credit card, it's a line of credit specific to one website that you purchase computer parts from.  I opened it around 2013 and have been slowly paying on it since (until I was unemployed).  At some point, they shut this credit program down so I could no longer pay on their website, I had to call them and make payments (I also could no longer use the account to purchase anything).

Around the time the other two credit cards were sent to collections, and I started getting calls from the agencies instead of the card issuers, the calls for credit card number 3 just stopped entirely.  I didn't get any calls, or snail mail regarding the account.

So right now I want to build my credit back up to a good standing.  I ran a report on Credit Karma, which shows Transunion and Equifax.  Both have a middle-of-the-road score, but when I look for accounts, the only ones listed are my auto loan and my student loan.  It also says I have a perfect history of paying on time, which would be true if my student loans and auto loan were my only debt, but that's not the case.  None of the other credit cards are even listed.

I applied for another credit card recently (for the purposes of building credit) and got denied and a history of delinquency was one of the reasons for it. 

So I did a separate inquiry for Expirian and I didn't get a number, but it was the same deal.  Only accounts listed were auto and student.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, is there some kind of credit check I'm missing?  From my limited understanding those are the big three bureaus, and I'm not sure where else to check.  If this account is quietly hurting my credit I'd like to know how I can verify that.  It also just seems weird that the other two credit cards weren't even listed.  There's even a section in Credit Karma that is supposed to list settled accounts.

t3_bzaptw,[Mortgage] Question on bank refusing partial payments,"Hi All,

Apologies as I know this is covered but I'm still confused. Perhaps this a little bit of an ELI5 moment.

I see posts like: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/53zdmu/bank_told_me_they_wont_accept_partial_mortgage/

Users there want banks to accept partial payments and credit them. I understand why the bank doesn't want to do that. I also understand how banks can refused to accept partial payments if the payments are late etc. 

To me partial payments implies that you're only making part of the payment not simply splitting the funds into two literal payments. Am I incorrect in this understanding?

Can you explain how a bank isn't required to accept literally split payments for the monthly payment? Let's say I owe $100 monthly payment. If I sent $50 from one bank account and $50 from another why are they allowed to refuse to accept the payment against the monthly payment?

I'm asking because I sent two payments due to being overseas (trying to figure out banking while overseas is not easy). The banks website payment &amp; some other features don't work when abroad even when using VPN for some strange reason it keeps timing out which I assume is a security measure. 

Anyways I submitted two payments and emailed asking them to be combined to pay the monthly payment. They told me they couldn't / wouldn't do this and applied the payments to the principal. 

Being very in PF this isn't a big deal aka I can just send another payment of the full amount before the payment is late but TBH I was surprised. It seemed like a small request. I wasn't asking them to do special crediting, I've been paying on time for forever, and adding $50 + $50 especially when told before the payment hits seems like a small ask. TBH I was surprised this was even legal as it's still legal tender against a loan. I used to work for a lending company and TMK this was never an issue. Lenders usually want their money and don't really care if you want to make it in 2 ACH payments or 1.

Is this just a mortgage servicers can do what they want because you signed a contract? I actually had my loan transferred to them (Cenlar) from Citi. Citi was always easy to use in comparison.",1
t3_bzj0c7,How will deferring payments on my high interest loan affect the total cost of the loan?,"My wife just switched jobs, so we're losing about half of our income for June. Because of this, I deferred the next two bi-weekly payments on one of my loans.

The outstanding amount on the loan is about $5,000 (that's the buyout price), and my bi-weekly payments are about $200. The interest rate is something like 29% (Yeah, I know).

In the confirmation email I received from the lender, they state:

""The original terms and conditions of your Personal Loan Agreement as indicated by your Personal Loan Account Number above continue to remain in force. Making changes to your scheduled payments, including deferring any payments that are due, will impact the date of your last payment as stated on your original loan agreement.

The amount of the missed payment being deferred will be added to the balance of your loan and will become immediately due on your next payment due date.  Please note that this will reduce the amount that is applied toward your principal balance on your next payment, and potentially subsequent payments, which will impact your cost of borrowing.""

I'm not sure exactly how much longer I have left on the loan, but I think it's about 2 years. For safety's sake, let's say it's 30 months.

How severely will these two deferred payments effect the already outrageous total I have to pay back?

t3_bzehfz,Taking 401K Loan For Moving / Rent,"Before I get bombarded with advice against this plan, I want to make clear that I am looking for opportunity and a new lifestyle. Those are more important to me than the typical lifestyle I have been living. 

I got a promotion job offering with the company I work for. (Multi-billion $ Corp) has offered me a significant raise from $18.65 hr to $24.65 hr. All good right? Well.... 
cost of living to where I will be relocating to (Denver - hour away in the mountains) is crazy high. Mainly because it is a vacation resort town for high class individuals. Cost of living where I currently reside is one of the lowest in the USA. I have grew up here all of my life and I am now 28 years old, always wanting to see the rest of the US. Now that I have this promotion opportunity, I feel like I need to make some major life sacrifices and take this. It would take me another 10 years just to get the same promotion and job title that I am taking for Colorado. The area I currently live is just so small and too competitive for others who want the job. 

So with that being said, I have no children. My wife (28) also works full time here and is moving with me to hopefully find work as well. We have written down a moving budget and all the expenses we will have until the 1 year lease is up. Let’s get to the numbers. 
Colorado -
Rent: $2600 month (crazy I know)
Utilities/internet: $180.00 month 
Car insurance: $90 month 
Own car no payment. 
No student loan or credit card debt. 
I currently contribute 6% and get 6% company match 401k. 
I contribute 4% to stock plan. 
With my wage increase from $18.65 to $24.65 I also get quarterly bonus and $400 allotment for rent. Technically the rent would only be $2200 month. 
I understand that over 50% of my income will be for rent  and it will be extremely tight if wife doesn’t find a job. 
Now savings we will have about $4000 out of pocket for the deposit and moving, additionally I am choosing to pull $12,000 out of my 401k as a loan to help with costs and offset the cost of living. The money definitely dwindles down quickly but with the new income and bonus/overtime I never go into the negative or end up not being able to pay the rent for the year. Now the plan is to obviously find something cheaper the next year, but this is literally one of the only properties we can find. 
So, I am looking at this move in a few ways: it is an investment to hopefully progress with work and move up, it is basically a year long vacation so I feel like I am justified in paying the high rent, and I need a challenge and a change of what I have seen for 28 years. 
Taking this promotion will get my “ foot in the door “ and allow me to take higher paying jobs in the future. 
I understand the downfall that is possible with taking the 401k loan back and being left to pay it back if something falls through. I know I am going to be scraping by and paying for just housing. But best case scenario, wife gets a job that pays higher for her too.  Even a small supplemental $2000 month would be more than enough for living when my expenses cover all the necessary bills and rent. 
I have gotten mixed replies when talking to people about this move. 
Any advice, encouragement (good and bad), and general help would be much appreciated. I am nervous but committed and excited! 

TLDR; moving 22 hours away to Colorado for promotion with job. Taking on a very expense lease for $2600 month on $24.65 hour plus bonus. Also taking $12,000 from 401k loan to help with move and cost of living.",1

t3_bzik54,Need an advice about credit card debt payments!,"Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

I finally had the realization that I have some credit card debts that I should be really serious about and stop pushing it like it doesn't exist! 

So my situation is that I have around $27000 credit card debt and I am wondering which way would be the best way to pay it. 

So i make around 88k a year with 8000 being an end of the year bonus. 

Here is the debt break down: 

Chase sapphire: 13k interest rate 18% 

Chase Freedom: 2K interest rate 25% 

Discover: 8K interest rate 25%

American express: 5k 25%

&amp;#x200B;

I got this discover personal loan offer for 18% for 25000 dollars for 48months

but Ive also seen balance transfer card offers that is around 18months

&amp;#x200B;

What would be the best way to deal with this? Should i just accept the personal loan from Discover and pay it monthly? 

Or apply for 2-3 balance transfer cards to pay them? 

What is also the best way for my credit in general? 

Thank you for all the help in advance",1
t3_bze1fd,403B to Roth IRA Issue,"I am a 27 year old teacher who stupidly signed up for a roth 403B with National Life Group a few years ago. I have a current balance of about $16,000 into this account, but it is only averaging a total of 1.96% interest over this time period. After some research on this sub, I decided to open a Roth IRA with Vanguard. I had everything ready with Vanguard to move in the $16,000 when NLG says it is against IRS laws to move these funds unless I have either changed employers or turned 59 1/2. So unfortunately it seems my $16,000 is stuck in NLG. They said the only way around this is a hardship life event such as a medical bill, funeral, foreclosure avoidance, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My current plan now is to stop contributing to NLG. I feel like I've wasted several years of compounding interest with the annuity but I don't seem to have another option. I plan to open up a Vanguard 2065 account and put $1,000 from my savings into it and essentially start all over again. I have only lurked on this sub until now, but it has been very helpful so far.

My current insurance just turned down the other party asking for a settlement for my limit because the lady is pretty much full of shit. My insurance called me and informed me of denying her asking for the settlement and that I might be served with a suit and that if that happened, they already have council in standby for me and that I wouldn't need to worry much about it, but that was about 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since or been served anything.  She claims that because of the accident, 1) she had to get a root canal due to biting down and embracing for my impact, 2) tore her labrum in her hip (which I always thought of as a ""usage"" injury), and 3) lost wages. All stemming from something that left me with one dent.

I haven't missed a single payment, and I have $5,739.27 remaining to pay off.  The length of the term for my existing loan is 36 months, and it was started on April 5th, 2018. My monthly payment is $291.14. Over 3 years, I would have paid $10,481.04 (291.14 x 36). Currently, I have no problem at all paying it off until the term is over, but I would like to save some money, like we all do, if possible.

I check my credit score regularly with Borrowell, and it is in pretty good shape. I'm 22 and I make $40,000 per year. Apart from this car debt, I have no other debt and I have a couple grand saved up for emergencies. Borowell also offers personal loans, and I see that I am pre-approved for a loan of $6,000 (roughly the amount I have remaining, before interest I assume). This loan is offered with an interest rate of 9.14, which isn't much lower than 11.45. The monthly payments on this new loan would be $191.71 and term is 3 years...

Is this a viable option in any possible situation?

Our salesman said that they would have to find another one that matched the same model and trim and get it shipped in. Since then I have been told it would be the 28th of May, last week and finally the 11th (today). First payment is due on the 15th and now the salesman has contacted me to let me know there was a delay from the factory and it would be the 24th before it would be here.

t3_bzhm9s,How do most people track their personal expenses? By accrual or cash basis?,"I just started my first full-time job and have really focused on preparing my budget to make sure I feel comfortable with where my money is going, how much I can save each month, etc. But I’m curious as to how people budget their expenses: by the month they occur, or when the cash is actually left? 

For example, I charge almost everything to my credit card, and that bill isn’t paid until the month after those charges accrue. 

A better example might be my water bill. I just learned it basically comes along with my rent bill for each month, but the rent is being charged for the next month, while my water bill is based on how much water I used last month. 

I assumed (like for the example above) I would just put the rent charge as paid for the next month (ex: July) while the remaining as my water bill will be accrued and “paid” for this month (June). However, since I am actually paying for both at the same time, it seems like this might make it difficult to keep track of how much leftover cash I should actually have at the end of each month (so I know how much to transfer to savings, invest, etc.) 

My thoughts to combat this were to possibly have my accrued income and expenses budget, and then make an “income statement” type budget where I strictly keep track of the money coming in and the money going out, but that seems like it could be a lot of work that I might not have to do. 

Anyone who has more experience in these matters than I, I would appreciate your thoughts on this (hopefully it makes sense!)

t3_bzeoff,Is this house too much of a dream for us? Financial objectivity needed,"Hello all, 

I need some financial clarity from objective sources. 

Over the past 8-9 years,  I’ve worked very hard to get rid of the debt my now husband and I had when we got together.  All in all, around 28k worth of debt at that time. 

Since then we have bought a house, outgrown it and have been looking at others. 
We also have increased our credit scores to around the 800 mark— up from bankruptcy caused low 600s for my husband and 620ish for me (starting out no real history) 
I have received two promotions and am in negotiations for another job that will bump me to the 100k per year salary.  It’s a done deal, minus the paperwork. I will have upward potential so I am sure in the next 2-3 years I’ll be making more. 

My current financial situation is as follows: 

Myself at 100k per year
Husband at roughly 50k 
5k in an emergency fund (planning to expand this out to a larger once we aren’t putting so much into a down payment fund) 
20k in a downpayment fund 
We sit at around 6-8k in our checking monthly
We are contributing but not maxing our 401k contributions, something that we will be changing in the future (new company will do match current company does not, husband works for current company with no match) 
My husband is going to be getting an inheritance of 30k this year, once legal has cleared it.  We plan on putting most of that (minus a vacation) in savings. 
We live in a part of the US where the average salary is 48k. 

No debt other than our mortgage.  I’ve paid that mortgage down 20k in the past 5 years.  Roughly 65k owned currently.  House should appraise for 110-120k range. 

Paid off my husbands truck
Paid off my car 
An everyday driver car for gas mileage that has no payment either. 

1200 a month is going back to our down payment savings per month 
I had been paying 1600 a month on our house to test how it would feel to make that large of payment — it’s fine thus far. So that’s 1k extra on the house per month. 

Now  we have found a house that checks off every one of our dream items.  It truly is a dream home for us. 

It is on the market for 345,000. We made an offer of 320k and got countered at 330k.  My husband and I walked away at that point because we had set the 320k as our max at that point. 

Now we are talking about possibly going back in a few weeks if the house is still on the market and I want to go to 330 to buy this house. My husband thinks that we might have looked at this house and went into dreamer mentality instead of reality. So he’s afraid to spend the 300+ on the house. Because he says it may not be financially responsible. 

So I’m here, hoping I can get objective opinions on if we are indeed dreaming of having something we shouldn’t go after. 

The breakdown of finances below: 

We are pre-approved for up to 450k via our mortgage lender. 

Looking at a payment of around 1800-2000 per month depending on the final sale price and using points for lower interest rate.  Already discussed with our mortgage lender. 

Utilities at the new house (verified with sources within the utility company) 
Water -50 per month 
Internet -40 per month 
Electric - average is 220, highest is 320 in the past year 
Trash- 15 per month
Insurance and taxes would be part of the mortgage per month

All the above is average to what we are spending at our current house minus the electric which would be a jump of 50-80 dollars for average/high. Of course the jump in mortgage per month. 

So my breakdown of everything: 

I clear 4746  per month
He clears on average - 2386 
Total: 7132 

Current situation bill total: 2,675 
Current going to downpayment savings: 1200
Current going to extra on the house:930 

Total: 4805 
Thus why our checking is growing monthly— we have shopped and spent more in the past few months than ever before, getting things we wanted etc since we had “extra” money so it could be larger than what it is if we hadn’t done that. 

New house factored at high end costs:
Mortgage: 2000
All other spending: 2,014 
Savings: 600 

Total: 4614 

Some costs go down, like storage unit not needed or internet costs reducing per month at the new house. 

If we had to carry the mortgage at our current until it sells- adding in the 670, 25 for water, 100 for electric. 
Total: 5409

t3_bzd1rn,Thinking of quitting job. Want opinions.,"Throwaway, since I can't afford for this info to get leaked. I work at a company in software development in Virginia and due to circumstances, I've been essentially doing nothing for 2 straight months, going on 3 months. I theoretically have job security though, so as long as I show up my job is safe. Because of where I work, I can't bring in a phone, headphones, or basically anything else electronic beyond car keys. Due to these circumstances, I have nothing effective to do with this time since I can't watch videos with no headphones and I'm supposed to look busy. Morale is very low at my company and several people have been leaving including people on my team. It's gotten so bad that I'm now in office about 2/3 of the hours that I say I am and I'm asleep most of the time I am there. They haven't noticed yet and I don't have a job lined up yet.

I'm heavily considering quitting because if I were to get caught, then I'd be in enough trouble to make finding a future job potentially near impossible. However, since I haven't been found out yet, my thought process is if I quit before anyone finds out I'm safe. I stop feeling like shit at work from boredom, I stop feeling like shit when I get home for leaving early and accomplishing nothing, and I no longer have to worry about the potential backlash from it. 

I have about 10k saved with immediate access and about 5k that I'd prefer not to touch. No kids or dependents. What do you guys think? I feel like if I stay here much longer, my skills are going to go stale and my work ethic may also suffer a serious blow, just like it appears my morality has. I can't afford to get used to taking home money for doing nothing.

I understand that it's easier to get a job, when you have a job but under these circumstances I feel like the risk is heavier for me staying. Also, I'm trying to build back up my morale enough to at least be there the bare minimum 40 hours I'm supposed to. However, it's gotten too low for the time being for me to be able to stay fulltime. 

And for those of you wondering, there are currently two ways my job here can go if I stay. First, I stay on the project I'm on and we hopefully get someone moved to our project that can give us direction, but based on past history it seems more likely that we'll be sitting on our hands. The other possibility is that I get moved back to the cluster fuck team, be begged (not required) to work overtime, and be testing software using an in house tool that will gain me zero experience that can be applied elsewhere and will also make me want to smash my head into my desk.

You may also suggest another place or a better place to post this.",1
t3_bz93k1,Wife lost feelings for me one day before purchasing and selling our new and old house. Need help.,"Tomorrow I am supposed to be signing the papers on both houses. Our old house got a cash offer which was lucky because after inspection we were sure a bank loan would not have accepted. With the profit from the sell I would have my debt paid off, roughly 26,000.

t3_byy9lp,My husband and I (25) feel so stuck in our finances. Please advise!,"We are 25. I just graduated college and got my first job (teacher) making $33,500. 
Husband has no degree, works as a manager at a trucking company and makes $40,000. 
Our monthly take home pay is about $4,300. 
 
This is our bill break down: 

Mortgage: 800

Truck: 450

Tractor (we live on land): 350

Car insurance: 250

Electric/water/gas: 200

Student loans: 550

Subscriptions (Netflix/gym/etc): 50

Gas (we both commute): 450

Groceries: 500

Credit card: 200

Hospital bills: 200 

House repairs: 150

Total: $4150 

So we should have $200 for savings, but just in general, life happens and it always gets used up. Usually traveling to visit mine or his family. About our house: we bought it 2 years ago for $90,000, no down payment (dumb). I think that is why our payment is so high. It is in need of major work (no floors on some spots, walls coming down), but luckily we do have some equity (~7% in it). We have thought about refinancing, and getting a home improvement loan to fix it, and making sure that when it is done we have 20% equity in it, so we could get out of PMI. I don’t think it would make our payment cheaper, because then it would be more like a $120,000 loan, but at least it would be more of an acceptable living space. I’m not into finance so I’m not sure how much any of this makes sense. 
We just have no cash flow to get anything accomplished, which we need to get the house assessed if that is what we want to do. My car is on its last leg, luckily my husband can mechanic pretty good, but there’s only so much he can do for a 25 year old beater. I feel like we don’t live an extravagant life, and I know there are people worse off, but we just want to be able to put some money into savings and still have some left over for spending each month. I feel like we work pretty hard for nothing you know? I got a job this summer since schools not in session, and I’m hoping to finally save up for a vacuum cleaner lol. I’ve applied for an after school position next year, and hopefully I’ll get it and it’ll bring in some extra income.  
Anyways. Sorry if this is not the right place! I’m newish to Reddit and definitely new to this sub! 
Thanks!!!

Edit: wow! Thank you all for the replies and advice! I thought I could reply to it all but I can’t, but I promise I did read everything. It may take 6 months to a year for us to get back on track but I can assure you we’re going to do everything we can, and I’ll update then! 
I think tractor is going to be first to go. We will lose a little bit of money on it and then we’re going to buy a mower just to mow the lawn. Have not discussed the truck at all yet but maybe to come in. Going to work on budgeting my groceries better and cutting down on spending there. We’re working on fixing up an old junk car we had and is soon as it can be sold all of that will go to pay off the credit card bill and hospital bills. Also some really great advice we’re shopping around for some cheaper insurance and I’ve already gotten some really good quotes. It’s crazy what you can accomplish in just one day looking at budget with the help of people online. I know a lot of people probably read my post and thought that we were just stupid and immature with our money but an actual reality we just didn’t know what to do and got in over our heads before we did any kind of research. I thought that was a reasonable truck payment and we both felt at the time that a tractor was what we needed but we’re both trying to come to terms and learning a lot today. Have not shown my husband this thread he doesn’t really get reddit if you know what I mean but I have been talking to about finances today, he’s wondering why all the sudden I’m so interested: It basically boils down to I want to freaking vacuum cleaner ha ha! But for real I can live with a broom and a dustpan for another year if we can get our finances under control and put money towards that and savings thanks again!
P.S. sorry if I came off as rude or passive aggressive! Honestly just embarrassed and glad Reddit is anonymous. I really appreciate people taking time out of their day to help me.",1

t3_bzhhwj,Is HVAC deductible on Investment Property?,"So here's the story applies for the year 2017:  My in-laws (wife's parents) are living in a home that I pay the mortgage on.  I do not live in the home.  I do not use it as a vacation home.  In all practicalities short of title it is my in-law's home that they maintain the small things and I pay for the major repairs.  My in-laws are retired living on Social Security only and we claim them as dependents on our taxes since I pay for more than 50% of their living expenses in the form of their mortgage and other household repairs and misc stuff.  They have just enough coming in to pay for food, utilities, and misc.  I also have purchased used vehicles for them.  Like I said, they would be homeless without me.  So they stay in a home that I pay the mortgage on that I am NOT using as rental property, but as an investment so that the money I put into paying the mortgage is like a piggy-bank.  When they pass away the value of the home will accrue when I sell it.

We had to replace the HVAC system because it was so old.  It could not be repaired, it had to be replaced.  I understand if it was a personal home I could not deduct the full cost of the HVAC, and if it was for a remodel I would have to depreciate over time.  And if it were a rental property as a business I could deduct the cost totally.  But this is sorta like a business property.  I would have purchased a house and let it sit there.

So in the eyes of the IRS: Can I fully deduct the cost of the HVAC (central air conditioner) replacement for this ""investment property""?  Also, I know for 2017 there was an energy credit for for $300/$500 that expired on Dec 31, 2017 that I can take advantage of.",1

t3_bzhgmb,Trying to figure out how screwed I am and what the best course of action is,"So, I've been worrying greatly about my financial situation and feel like no matter what I do, it just keeps getting worse. While I know that I'm at least partly to blame for my situation (my wife hasn't exactly helped), I'm hoping there's some form of solution that I'm just unaware of.  


The main problem is we have a lot of credit card debt, mostly due to spoiling the kids and my inability to say no to my wife (and have it stick when I do). We're probably not in the worst situation, but I see it slowly slipping more and more and it worries me.  


Total Credit Card debt across 4 cards is around $30K. We have two newer vehicles, which total probably about $40K, and owe around $100K on our house. There's also a loan out for $15K. After paying all these bills, as well as the standard cable/power/water/phone/etc, there's somewhere between $300 to $500 left a month. Our daughter is active in cheerleading, which is pretty expensive some months, and we pay a babysitter somewhere between $200-$400 a month. We also have some additional bills that are behind, which I'd like to take care of as well. Also, we currently have next to no savings.

Needless to say, things keep falling behind and show no sign of slowing down. Most of the loans for the cars/personal have 6-ish years left. I'm already working two jobs, although the pay from the side gig has dipped some. I'm not sure what I need to do to ease some of the financial strain.

Should I attempt to apply for 0% for X month cards and transfer balances if possible? We attempted to look into a home equity loan, but were not really successful. Are there other suggestions?

2nd: Borrow from 401K and pay back within 4 years.  

I know both are not ideal for paying off debt but we have to start somewhere.  I am leaning towards the 401K because of the following:

To be fair, I manage the accounting for multiple locations and I handle a lot of dollars, but while I'm flattered to be contacted as a Controller, it seems above me.

Anyone work as a Controller here or report to one? What can you tell me about your experience?",1
t3_bzhc5x,Can I get insurance on my brother's car?,"So, due to an unexpected turn of events I am now in possession of my younger brother's car, which he cosigned the loan, along with his ex. The insurance was in her name, but she stopped making payments on it and the policy was cancelled. We do not live in the same place, and also the loan, title, and registration details are all partially in his name. However, I will be driving the car all the time and making the payments. My concern is if I insure the car (my insurance is through GEICO in NC) and I get in an accident, are they going to deny a claim based on the fact I'm not the owner of the car? Is it better if he adds the car to his own insurance even though I am the main driver?",1
t3_bzhbw4,Odd questions about W2 requirement (USA/ California),"I was talking to a longtime, upper management employee of a large company with its US HQ in California. He mentioned that, when they decided he was the preferred candidate, they required a copy of his W2 from the previous year so they could assemble the right ""pay/benefits package"" offer for him. I had never heard of this, but then I've never worked for a company that big before. I asked him how the resulting package came out, and it was extremely competitive.

My questions are many: Has anyone else run in to this before? Is it even legal in some or all states? Why even do it in the first place?

Of course, let me know if this should go to another sub. I posted here first because it sounded in line with some other questions I've seen here before.

t3_bzh54y,Questions about Taking part of a Pension,"Hi all,I am 24 working for public universities, with access to a pension from the state. Currently, debt-free and focusing on my finances. Now I've read so much on investments and retirement plans, and it's fair to say that pensions are rare. For those who may be able to help, I'm curious about the general wisdom of what path to take on the options this pension has. I'll be as short and to the point as much as I can. For those in Ohio, it's called OPERS (opers .  org). I'm currently leaving the OPERs pension plan for a new job, and I've noticed most other pensions plans in other states are relatively similar. I am required to contribute 10% of my salary and where they go/do base on three options I choose. The three options are

1: Traditional (what I currently selected). Where they have the value of the account based on the time you've worked there. No market risk, you receive a percentage match of your contributions after five years (33% of contributions) of working and after ten years (67% contributions). To immensely simplify the formula for retirement, if you were to retire from this and have many years of service, it's giving an average of your top salaries and paying that to you for the rest of your life. I can leave it in deposit if I leave the pension program. If I do that, I keep my service credit in case I come back to the pension plan, but the amount will only grow at 1%. You can see a potential con if you don't plan on staying long, and if you work less than five years, you get nothing from the employer. But a pro would be, if I work there long enough, I will at least receive an employer contribution if I leave again, or if I retire from this plan, I will have a good salary post-retirement.

2:  Member-Directed. Similar in a sense to a 401(k) where I pick the investment. I can do a combo of target-date funds, and your typical index stocks (large cap, small, foreign), bonds and others index funds as well. I receive an employer contribution (a certain percentage) after **one year** of service, and the rate goes up by 20% every year, starting at 20, capping at 100%. If I were to leave, I can leave it on deposit and let the market do its thing, but a variable $5 fee appears monthly. In hindsight, I probably would've picked this option now since I am leaving, but I like this because you get the employee contribution earlier. If I retire from this plan, it'll be similar if this was a 401(k). The big thing the OPERs customer services warns me of is that of course, it will fluctuate with the market, but I personally don't care as much as long as it is in a good index fund.

3) A mix of both

If my job change works out and I do leave this pension program, I plan on transferring what I currently have to a traditional IRA to do more than the 1% and losing my one year of service credit. I do get one chance as a member of the plan to change it to a different option midway, but I lose the years of service to earn a contribution from the employer. I didn't think too much about it when I first got the option, but when approached with the opportunity again, which should I choose? The only question, I cannot answer is how long do I plan on staying with the organization. I did over-generalize a lot of things about the pension, but I am just looking for general wisdom if you had this situation! Thank you for the chance to discuss!",1
t3_bzh4sh,Hard inquiry for no reason with bad timing,"I recently bought some furniture, and they offered 10% off if I purchased through their ""preferred"" financing, which means I get a bill 30 days post delivery and pay it off in one shot. I recently obtained a high sign up bonus credit card specifically to use it for this purchase, so I asked them multiple times if I could use a credit card to pay off this balance. They yes'd me all the way through. When they asked for my SSN, there was a checkbox stating ""I agree to sign up to X bank credit card"". I again asked them if this was an actual credit card, because I want to use my card for the balance. They swore it wasn't. I gave then my ssn and they ran my credit.

 However, when I'm going to pay, they hand me a document requesting signature that I approve this ""X bank credit card"" again. I told them that I do not feel comfortable with how many times credit card keeps coming up. Manager overhears me and comes over. He confirms it is a line of credit and you CAN'T use a credit card to pay it off. I told them I'm not interested in it anymore, but the inquiry was already made. After threatening to walk, they let me keep the discount and charge my own credit card directly. 

But now I've just run an inquiry for this ""credit card"", the actual credit card I just obtained for this purchase, another in December (churning, I don't carry balances), and I'll be applying for mortgages in a month or so. Since this inquiry was literally useless and only performed because I was lied to, is there any way to dispute this? I don't yet see the affect it's had on my credit since it was a few days ago, but I'm afraid all of these inquiries will start affecting my credit in a major way and give me trouble with my mortgage. Am I worrying over nothing?",1

t3_bzh38v,Should I let my lease turn into month-to-month for $150 more?,"Situation: 

I am currently in process for an out-of-state police recruit job. Recruiters told recruits that if we made it through the process, we should expect to be in the mid-September or November academy. I'm unsure of how much weight I should put into this. 

Our lease ends on Aug 31, 2019  and our management company emailed us to inform us that if we were to renew before June 30, we would keep the rent the same. Notice of renewal after June 30, the rent would increase $40/month. They also stated that ""if you do not make us aware of your plans to renew by the time your lease expires, your lease will become a month-to-month lease and you will be charged a monthly fee for that flexibility of $150.""

My SO dislikes our current apartment (loud and rowdy neighbors, she does not feel safe) and would like to move, but I am of the opinion that if I get the job, we would end up moving maybe 3 months into a 1 year lease and have a huge hassle of trying to get out of it. Even if we were to move into a short term lease apartment, there are still moving costs involved. 

We currently pay $1435 for a 2 bed, 1 bath, 1 parking spot, W/D in unit. 1 cat, 1 dog. Chicago, IL.

Should we move into a short term apartment ? We could find a place cheaper, smaller, and sell off possessions to pay for the move in anticipation of a job offer? I anticipate at least \~$1000-1500 in moving costs, which include first month, deposits, app fees, pet fees.

Or should we stay in this lease and convert to month-to-month so it would be ? That would be no moving costs, but our rent increases by $150. Would the landlord be open to negotiating the month-to-month fee? We have only been in this apartment for 9 months, but our rent has always been paid on time.",1

That said, I know I have unpaid medical debt. I had surgery in 2017 and could not afford the full cost so I only paid part of it and expected to see a bill from the hospital. But the bill never came. Nor did I get a bill from my surgeon. And I have had no creditors calling me either. Is it possible they just wrote it off? I expected it to be around $1500 or so. I don't want to wake up any creditors by poking into this or calling the hospital, but I also don't want to get a surprise on my credit report if it goes unpaid.

t3_bzgw8g,Am I saving/investing enough (or too much?) for my kids future and education?,"Looking for advice/feedback on our savings/investment for our kids.  I know they're supposed to come last, and outside of my husband's 401K needing more attention, we're on solid footing, I think. 

Our finances: $150K household income. Emergency fund is solid. Maxing out HSA. Both of our ROTH IRAs are fully funded for 2018/2019 (we just opened them this year using savings). I'm on track to max out my ROTH 401K this year, and husband is playing catch up with his Trad 401K contributions b/c he started saving late. We just upped his amount to 12% of his salary. It was at a pathetic 3% up until earlier this year. Come September, we'll have about $800 more a month to invest when daycare costs are cut in half. 

&amp;#x200B;

Outside of retirement, we are saving $300/month -- $100 for each kid into a savings account, and $100 for us into a savings account. We may have to reduce the amount we're setting aside for the kids to make sure husband's 401K is on track, but we want to continue to invest SOMETHING for them. Right now, the money is kind of all over the place and I'm not sure if I should be focusing it into their 529 or elsewhere. Here's where we are at.   


— $5K in child A's 529 (opened this year with savings/tax refund)

—$3K in child B's 529 (opened this year with savings/tax refund)

—$8K in child A's  five-year CD (from a combination of savings and gifts)

—$5K in child B's five-year CD (from a combination of savings and gifts)

—Currently setting aside $100/month for each child in a savings account.  Those accounts have $400 in them at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Ideally, we'd hope that our children would consider community college or trade school before pursuing a 4-year university. We see a lot of value in that financially (cheaper!) but who knows what they'll want to do when they're older (we have at least 13 years before college). On one hand, I'm slightly afraid of putting too much money in a 529 to have them not use it/not need it in the future, which is why we also have the CDs. But on the other hand, I can't see a world in which they WONT need to pay for some college education. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my questions: 

Should we be taking that $100/month (or less, if we have to reduce it for husband's 401k) for each child and investing it straight into the 529 instead of the savings account?  

When the CDs mature, should we put them or some of it into the 529s? 

What do you do for your kids' future savings/college investment? 

Am I saving too much for them? Not enough?",1

First time posting on this subreddit (and a while in general); Anywho, im looking for some advice..

I have a PARs fracture in my lower back and am needing surgery. I went through months of Chiropractic treatment and Physical therapy to still have no relief in my pain. I am avoiding Narcotics heavily, and therefor am left with the option of surgery.

On to financials;

I am 23, gonna be 24 in August. I have a wife and an 8 month old son. Our financials have never been in a great place unfortunately, but have always been able to get us by.. until about a month ago when my pain started getting unbearable. I was working roughly 45-50hrs a week @ $14 an hr (with overtime being anything after 40hrs). As of now (6/10/19) i am working less than 25hours a week.. I don't do a ridiculously demanding job (Manager of a small Retail Store), but bending, standing for long periods of time, kneeling, climbing up ladders, ETC are extremely difficult to do; which are basically my job requirements. Light work isn't possible because we typically only have 1 person running the store at a time (plus, whats REALLY much lighter than that?!) So at the moment, it is getting harder and harder to work, therefor i am losing a good chunk of my normal pay..

My wife works for an HR company, with a salary of a little above 30k/yr.

The other thing i am concerned about..

After my surgery, i will have a recovery time of \~12 weeks. Which is a rough time to go without any sort of income on my end.

We don't have hardly ANY kind of savings (\~$250), CC debt isn't the best either (\~$1500 between me and my wife),

Big concerns are; House payment, Car payment, and utilities (with food and gas among the obvious others)

With CC payments &amp; School loans falling behind that

Job/State does not offer/require Short-Term Disability or FMLA

So here i am, looking for something, ANY kind of advice that can give me a decent amount of hope to get through this.

So, i have a few questions i suppose?

1. Are there any recommendations for any kind of Income that can get me through this time? (Obviously being restricted to basically a chair at this point) I have some working background in IT. With knowledge in certain software and physical hardware.
2. I am also worried that after my initial recovery time, i may have trouble adjusting back to work and don't want to push myself and come near this state again. Should i consider doing something else? (Career/Job)

I've checked out most of the r/sideincome and r/WorkOnline. But i can't really see much that would be beneficial enough to help me out.. Maybe im missing something...

I honestly didn't expect to even type this much tonight.. but i guess details are important. I can provide more if needed, these are just the mains that i felt like had to be listed

And, uhh.. Thanks for reading/hearing about my problems (lol)

TL;DR: I am having Surgery, already falling behind on bills, and will be out of work for another 3 months as part of recovery. Looking for any kind of advice that can help me get through this rough time with my family..",1

If it's for spending money, should you not put any money into stocks as having stocks for shorter than 10 years is relatively risky I believe (read it from the sidebar I think) and you should probably aim for a house around 30-35? Just in case you haven't figured out, I'm stupid and young on this stuff.

t3_bzgdll,Questions About College Loans and Financial Situation,"Hopefully this post actually gets posted to this sub-reddit
(last post got hidden by automod). 

so...I am 18 and going off to college at Drexel University for a five-year program for Architectural Engineering. Drexel really seems like a good fit for me but I need to pay 68,000 a year to go there, and that is with financial aid and scholarships. Regular tuition is nearing $100k a year. I called the school and they told me I have received the maximum amount of aid for my program but that seems ridiculous since both my parents are disabled and I have managed a 4.0 GPA all through high school. I didn't expect a full-ride but I also didn't expect this. I should also note that I have no money saved up due to job hopping for years, my parents have no money saved up, only $600 to help cover living costs and books and are now moving in with my grandparents as they could no longer afford living on their own.

I have confirmed my enrollment but I am considering withdrawing. I want to leave town like every high school senior but I just have this gut feeling that maybe I should go to community college since I am already enrolled. 

After five years at Drexel I would be $250k in debt if I didn't apply for scholarships. Drexel does have a good co-op program that can pay roughly $15k per year (for three years) to help chip away at the loans. I am also pretty confident I can get a job afterward. But with a starting salary around $50k, I am not confident I can pay off those loans. Maybe If I was making $80k a year but I can't assume that I'll be making that much.

But if I don't go, I feel like I would be wasting time and my potential(?). I have thrown around the idea of waiting a year to go to university but my family is super-against that option and I was told it is harder to go to a school that I would like. I have also considered ROTC but that only looks like it will help with federal loans, with which I only have $5k per year of, and living costs. 

So does anybody have advice on what I should do. I guess I am asking whether or not I should I take my chances with being $250k in debt or just try to keep applying to other schools even though there are not many with my degree? Can I even get a loan for that much (70k) with zero credit history and my parents having bad credit? Is it reasonable to assume I can work hard to pay off those loans?

t3_bzgbdy,How do you appropriately save for retirement as a HCE?,"I just got off the phone with a company I've been interviewing with and its sounding like they're working on putting an offer together. In anticipation of that I wanted to figure out what things are going to change for me and how I should navigate those changes.

I'm currently making $104K with up to a 10% bonus at the end of the year, totaling around $114K. I'm also currently in the pool of eligible promotions, which itself is up to a 10% raise, so I could theoretically see myself making $125K by the end of the year if everything falls into place.

I haven't received the formal offer yet, but this new job has a salary range of $120K-$130K right out of the gate and also comes with a bonus program.

I'm currently making maximum contributions to my 401(k) and my Roth IRA (already maxed out for this year). If I take this new job or things do fall into place with my current employer I'll soon be in the HCE pool which from all my research has told me that my contribution cap would be limited by the average contribution of the non-HCE employees at the company + 2%. So, since I wouldn't be able to put the same amount away via 401(k) contributions - what should I do?

I've never been in this situation before (naturally) and am not really sure how to best traverse it. I currently do most of my saving in what I call a ""passive"" way - all the money gets divvied up between various accounts and the only money that I get to ""use"" goes into other accounts so I never really ""see"" the full amount to get all wide-eyed. I don't want to just pack more money away into a generic savings account because I know it's more useful elsewhere. I've read about ways to put money into Roths via some ""backdoor"" way of transferring money, but not sure how exactly to go about doing that.

I'm planning to talk to a financial planner when this ""issue"" comes to a head (also because I'm getting married in March so that'll be something else to navigate).

In either case, I'm open to any and all suggestions when it comes to methods for saving money. Thanks!",1

I always pay off my full balance on time and I use about 20% of my limit. The card I use the most is my Walmart Rewards Mastercard. I have been using it for about two years now.

- CASHBACK!!!!!!!!!! For the BMO SPC Mastercard I get up to 5% in the first 3 months and then after 1% on every purchase
- student discount of 10 to 15% off on a bunch of stores
- my HBC Mastercard is my newest credit card (about 1 year old)

&amp;#x200B;

 The 5-year rule means that five tax years must pass from the date of the first contribution to ***any*** Roth IRA, or Roth 401(k), before a qualified distribution can be made from the retirement account. The 5-year rule is fairly straightforward in a Roth IRA.  However, what many taxpayers may not realize, is how that 5 year rule is calculated when you rollover a Roth 401(k). If the rollover is to a Roth IRA, the [holding period](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/holdingperiod.asp) within the Roth 401(k) does not carry over.  Which means, if you have an existing Roth IRA, once the Roth 401(k) distribution is in the account, it has the ***same holding period as the Roth IRA funds.***

t3_bzfm02,"Paycheck Given To Me Year Later, Advice?","Hello,

  
For the basics, I'm a college student who is home for the summer as an hourly wage earner. I am at the same job I worked the summer before going to school. When I went to collect my first paycheck, I was given my final check for my last week of work. I know I should've checked if my hours worked and pay matched up, but I was busy moving across the country for school and did not.

&amp;#x200B;

I put the check into my account via ATM, and the bank has withdrawn it as the check is expired. I realize I should've thought about this but I just deposited it without thinking after a long shift. What are my options, the check was a significant enough sum to me that I would like to know how to go about getting that money back.

t3_bzfjcg,I found out I owe back taxes. How do I go about paying it?,So this was incredibly irresponsible of me but when I filed my taxes I owed about $1200 California taxes but had a 2500 tax return from federal. I assumed they would take it from my return but going over my bank statements I realized they have not. I'm not used to this as I'm not from the country and at a bit of a loss. Where do I go to pay this? Does it have to be at once or can I pay it in installments? Am I currently in legal trouble? Thank you in advance for any help.,1
t3_bzfja4,What my next move?,"Hey everyone. Currently I owe:
$6610.98 in total credit card debt - $3700 was closed by Bank of America because of late payments. I'm working on a plan for this debt 

($2400 is deferred interest that'll be paid off before interest accrues fully)

$12,000 car loan

70,000 student loans

I make 60k/year and I've been using YNAB to budget for my bills each month and putting the rest toward debt. I've paid off nearly 3k in the last couple months after setting up a plan. 

I went on an income based repayment since all of my loans are federal. 

I have about $700 a month I can put toward debt after budgeting everything for my expenses, dining out, etc. 

Here's what I've got going on personally:

I just got out of a 3-4 year stint to where I was living paycheck to paycheck with barely enough money to buy groceries. I was swiping my card hoping I had enough for $30 in groceries. I'm now in a much better spot and my life has improved tremendously in the last 6 months. I've begun the process of paying down all of my debt and becoming financially secure. 

I need to get cavities filled and a root canal. Need to get eyes fixed up with a new prescription. I need a check up and a couple other things.

I'm trying to figure out what my next move is. I'm about to pay off a card in full this month which will leave me with the deferred interest card and the BofA card. 

Should I try to apply for a balance transfer card to transfer the BofA balance to stop accruing interest? If I don't get approved for the balance transfer card should I get a personal loan from a local CU with lower interest and pay that down that way?

For those of you that are financially literate and secure, what would you do? 

I'm following a debt snowball which would have me debt free very soon. 

Thanks for your advice and help!

Edit: my next move should also be to spellcheck the title of the post. Lol",1
t3_bzfg9k,Recent graduate looking to build credit (CAN),"Hello. Recent engineering grad looking to soon own a car and eventually own a home. I currently have ~$20k of student debt, but based on savings and income it should be paid off a month after my repayment starts. I have a single credit card with a limit of around $2k as my only line of credit, generally under 50% utilization, that has been consistently paid monthly for the last five years. 

Does the amount of credit I have to my name affect my credit score? If so should I open additional lines of credit now? My thinking is that this will give them some time to mature, as I probably need the greater part of a decade before taking out a mortgage.

t3_bzb93x,Index Fund or TSP?,"Thanks for all your advice in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the rundown: I am 28 years old, married, own my home (no mortgage), own my car (no loan), have no debt, and work for a government agency (current salary: $100k gross, $2,400 bi-weekly paycheck; lifetime salary cap: $160k gross). My husband generally manages our home/car/dog/life/bill paying etc, and has a part-time job (about $20k a year gross). We live in the DC area and will probably stay, and our post-deduction expenses (taxes, car insurance, cost of driving, groceries, bills, going out, vacations, etc) are something like $50k annually. We get life insurance, health/dental/vision insurance, a health flexible spending account, Thrift Savings Plan (retirement plan, matched up to 5% by employer, I am currently putting in 6%), etc through my job, which bring our net from my job to about $63k a year. We are hoping to have a baby in the next 3 years, and will only be having one. My husband will be the primary caretaker and will most likely stop working. I also have a Roth IRA and we have an index fund with about $20k in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next March, I am getting a 550k inheritance, and we are trying to figure out how to allocate that money. Our main question is whether I should (option 1) take a low net pay and max out my TSP ($19k annually) and to make up for the lowered paycheck by pulling from the 550k, which would be sitting in one/several index funds OR (option 2) to put some money into TSP (like I'm doing now) but primarily use my paycheck for expenses and leave the 550k in one/several index funds to grow untouched. I've run the numbers on both options, and option 1 gets us about 6 million in TSP and option 2 gets us about 8 million over 40 years, but my understanding is that option 1 is much less risky.

&amp;#x200B;

Other retirement accounts: Roth IRA (maxed every year), and a pension plan through my job (about $80k annually, once I retire). I can carry my health/dental/vision insurances into retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Is there something else we should be doing with the 550k? Thanks!!",1

EDIT// I took the first few steps to fixing my credit thanks to you guys. I just checked everything like you guys said, and ordered a secured card. Here’s a bit more questions:


I just applied and have a secured 200$ card coming to me. I have a question about using it.

So can I use all the 200$ In a week, refill the 200$, then by the end of the month, just use 20$ before the statement comes,and it’ll show 10% ultilization right? Aka, can I use all the money on the card as much as I want, as long as I put enough money to get it up to 180$ before the statement date? For the 10$ use, then pay it off by due date.
Is my goal to only get 10% usage on it per statement, then pay off that 10% by the “due date” ?

I have 4 delinquent charges ruining my credit

1: discover card, (paid on time for 2 years, then 3 years of C/O after missing 3 to 4 payments. (Means charged off)

2: a hospital visit, never paid, in collections

3: another hospital, in collections

4: a payment plan for an online item (bought a  1000$ item, with 250$ payment, paid next month, then didn’t pay rest) in collections

So I have,
Discover Fiancial, still filing C/O every month for 800$

Is there anyway to get discover to remove all the C/O’s?, and is there a way to get the collection agency’s to remove them if I offer to pay them off?",1

The first is a card through my bank that my dad's name is also on. I had it since college but feel like it's not worth keeping since my wife and I started new accounts together and I'd like to sever financial ties with my parents. It's the only one I paid interest on but it's now paid off.

The second was a jewelry card I used to finance an engagement ring. I paid it off before it gathered any interest.

The last is a joint card between my wife and I, that we opened because of some attractive incentives that we took advantage of when paying for our wedding. That's also been paid off before it gathered any interest. We don't have a need for its cash back since it'll gain interest if we carry a balance, and her credit card she's adding me to has better perks.

t3_bzds77,Closed accounts after auto refinance and student loan consolidation,"Sorry for the wall of text. TL;DR at the bottom.

Hi all. I've been lurking for some time, and with help of this sub and Credit Karma, I raised my credit score from 641 to 758 this year. My wife and I have paid off our credit cards (about $6,500), refinanced our car, saving us $90 a month, and with my new credit score I was finally able to get approved to consolidate my student loans bringing my monthly payment from $1,100 to $400. My wife's student loans are completely paid off as of last month. I feel like I can finally breathe as a huge financial burden has been lifted. We're a single income ($49,500 USD, about $36,000 adjusted gross income on last year's taxes) family with one child. With things paid off and the student loan payment drastically lowered, we can finally think about building/buying a house sooner than later. We're graciously in a work-to-pay-your-rent type situation right now with a family that has been very sympathetic about our student loan situation which as allowed us to put that money into paying off debts.

My auto refinance just appeared on Credit Karma, and closing the old loan account and opening a new loan account both have a negative impact of about 6 points in total, which I expected. However, I'm more nervous about the closing of my old student loan accounts (7 in total). I've had some of these open for almost 10 years making on time payments. When they're closed, will those 10 years of credit history be removed from my report? If so, how much can I approximate my score to go down? Likewise, since the old auto loan was only open for less than 2 years, would it be possible/beneficial to call and have it removed from my credit report?

I'd like to pursue a loan for a home or to build a home in the near future, and a 750+ credit score has been incredible for the refinancing I've been able to do over the past couple months. I'd hate to see my score go way down after making so much positive progress. Thanks in advance for your comments!

**TL;DR:**

* Got my credit score up from 640 to 758 this year.
* Refinanced 2 year old car loan. Old loan was closed, which negatively affected credit by a few points. Refinanced loan was  opened, causing a drop of a few points. Would it be possible/beneficial to call and have the old auto loan removed from my credit report since it was so short? Would that make my score go up a bit? I only ask because I'm awfully close to going under 750.
* 7 student loan accounts will be closed on my report soon since they have been consolidated. These were between 6-10 years old with on time payments. Will the closing of these accounts have a large impact on my credit score?",1

t3_bzjbzo,"Chase shows 2 credit scores, can I dispute this?","If I go on my Chase account it shows my credit score as a 689 and says it's through Vantagescore. I applied to my first credit card and I was accepted. When I got the card and all the paperwork it said my credit was a 662 based on card acquisition risk score V2. I think it's pretty shade to show my credit as one thing and then use your own more stringent system so that my credit limit is lower than I would expect. It's also annoying because this means I can't check my Chase account to see where they put my credit score, how do I know if it's going up? Do you think there is any way I could dispute this to get a higher credit or do I just have to grit my teeth and bare it?

Edit: I understand that your score is different depending on what site you go through. My issue was both scores are through the same company. If the Chase app says ""this is your credit score according to us"" then I would expect that to be the score they use, but it's not. It just seems shady to me if a company was like ""yeah your credit score is this according to a certain site."" then when you go to use their services they say ""we don't actually USE that score, we have our own.""",1

t3_bzdm56,Bank taking too long to refund money,"Not sure if this is the right forum for this problem, but what are my options if my bank is taking too long to refund my money?
The situation: took a small loan from my bank. About 2 months ago, when the remaining amount was 7756$, I paid it off in full. The remaining amount was 7656$ principal + 100$ interest. I made the deposit in person. I told the teller I wanted to pay off the loan and she said okay. Unfortunately she applied the entire payment toward the principal of 7656$, so basically I overpaid the principal by 100$ and the interest amount of 100$ still remained. A month later when I checked again, I saw the bank made an auto withdrawal from my  account equal to my monthly payment (500$) to cover the 100$ interest. I immediately went to the bank and explained the situation to them. They agreed a mistake had been made and to refund my money in the amount of 500$. A month later, I got a check for 400$. Went back again and this time they said they would have to escalate the issue for the 100$ and asked me not to cash the 400$ check. It's been another month now and I don't know what to do. I'm not a confrontational person by nature, nor can I yell at people. How do I get the bank to correct their mistake? Is there an agency I can threaten to report them to so they give back my money? The folks at the bank are nice and assure me the issue will be rectified, but I feel I'm being taken advantage of. My wife thinks I should just let the 100$ go, but I'm loathe to do this. The bank should not just take someone's money and take it's own sweet time paying it back is what I feel.Thanks.

t3_bz3yar,"59 year old mother is struggling financially, how can I help her get out of debt and learn how to budget?","I am an early 20s college grad living in the Midwest. My mom has never been the best at handling her finances (I’m fairly certain she’s been in significant, worsening debt to every type of lending agency under the sun for as long as I’ve been alive). I discovered she had around ~$10,000 in debt/collections right before I began college four years ago. About two years ago, my grandfather/her father passed away and she inherited a decent amount of money and investments from him, but I was never really told how much. But it was enough for her to 1) pay for a new SUV in cash, 2) eat out/have food delivered nearly every night, and 3) move into/pay the deposit on a more expensive apartment than the one she had lived in previously. I don’t think she put any of it towards paying off her debt. To her credit, she is very generous and helped me out when I was having issues with my school funding and stipend disbursement, which of course I’m extremely grateful for.

Her spending habits have pretty much remained the same for the past two years, up until February/March of this year. She came to me asking if I could borrow $2000 from a small fund my grandparents (my father’s parents; my mom and dad divorced years ago) have invested intended for each of their grandchildren’s education, or in my case if I decide to go on and get a masters; apparently she had taken out multiple payday loans and title loans on her car. I obviously didn’t feel comfortable with this, as I’d have to lie about the reason I was withdrawing the money from the account to my grandparents, so I told her that was something I couldn’t do. Instead, I gave her as much as I could out of my own savings (literally all of it since I didn’t have a full-time job as a student, about $1000) so she could pay her rent and eat. I also had her ask HR to start depositing her paycheck onto a special debit card, since the payday lenders automatically take essentially her entire paycheck from the account her paycheck used to be deposited in.

About every week since then, she has been requesting money for food/gas/etc. Small amounts around $20-$40. This doesn’t sound like much, but I’m in the process of securing a full-time job now that I have a degree and have had barely enough hours at my current student job to pay my own bills. I’m behind on basically everything at this point, my credit score has dropped, and I’ve been stressed beyond belief. I want to help her in a way that might actually fix her situation long-term. From what I understand, her options are:

A) Credit consolidation service - a few months ago I researched local credit counseling services and found a highly rated organization that was close to where she lives. She went to an appointment there but was told she’s about $450 short in monthly income to afford their services. I expect to be employed full time in the next month or so, so I could probably fill in the gap and help her afford this. I absolutely want to help her, but 450+ per month from me would still be a pretty significant chunk of my expected paycheck (I didn’t get a very technical degree, unfortunately).

B) Bankruptcy - she really doesn’t have any assets, so aside from the upfront cost (around $2000, from what I’ve read) I feel like this might be her best option. Again, she has a ton of outstanding debt and a crappy credit score to begin with, so I don’t think the consequences of filing would worsen her situation any.

Unfortunately she seems to think that having her paycheck deposited on a card her lenders can’t touch and having me fill in the gaps is a solution, even though I try to explain that it’s not. Not because I’m selfish - I love my mom and truly want to help - but eventually, her car will be repossessed and neither of us could afford to replace it. I have a feeling this will continue to be a problem for the rest of her life, and I don’t want our relationship to be based solely on my ability to support her (this is how her and my grandfather’s relationship was when he was alive, and it was toxic).

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",1

t3_bzdbmf,"I really need some debt advice, my debt has become a huge mess after a medical leave and I don't know where to start","Long post ahead

So back story, I've been in debt for a few years but had it handled in a sense. There was a lot of it but I always paid on time and had a great credit score. The years I was building up to debt was due to having some pretty rough depression and I was using debt/spending as a coping mechanism. Back in October my depression got really out of hand and I was making a plan to commit suicide. Had a note written, a plan, everything. I decided instead of taking my life to take a leave from work and get help so I checked myself into an outpatient mental health center for 3 months which basically saved my life.

Fast forward to today and I'm doing absolutely great!! I'm happy for once in my life, working at an absolute dream job building race cars I landed a few months ago, I'm in great shape, I smile a lot now, and I haven't had a suicidal thought in 4 months. However during my time there I wasn't getting paid, still had bills, and was living off whatever credit I had left on my cards to get by but for the sake of my health I had to convince myself to not focus on my debt since it was a triggering stressor. Stupid I know but it's what I needed to do at the time.

Going back to work and getting on my feet after the leave was pretty rough but eventually, things started working out. I was mechanic at a shop with an abusive boss who made me feel terrible about myself regularly and the pay was shitty but I had awesome health insurance and a 401k and all that jazz. A few months ago I got sick of the bullshit and took a day off to job hunt and found the current job I'm at now.

Its a dream job, I spend all day working with race cars and talking with the coolest customers and making so many connections in the high performance car and racing world. It's childhood dream stuff and it's been incredible for my mental health. I get paid decently, 600-700 à week depending on hours I'm here however it's split half cash half check.

I have about 50k in debt including my car payment which is the only bill I've been on top of since my car is how I get to work along with being a big part of my social life and my hobby. My car insurance payments are 300/250 respectively and I spend about 40-50 à week on gas since I have a long commute though I get about 27-30 mpg on Premium gas(car can only take premium.) 

Now my other debt is the real mess. I have 15k between two cards plus 19k for a debt consolidation loan that's 1500 over due along with my 2 card being paid well below the min the past few months. I have some medical debt I don't even know how much it is yet but I'm going to guess around 5-8k, I haven't paid my federal or state taxes yet which are $1200, I probably have some other debts too. 

So where the hell do I start? What the hell do I do? I feel like I have a fresh start on life and I feel like I'm where I want to be but this is just a huge dark cloud I'm facing and just am lost. I put no blame on anything or anyone but myself for getting myself into this mess and I want to work to get myself out it.

Ive thought about a second job by my main job schedule is way too hectic to fit it in however I have access to an insurance payout from my leave I haven't cashed in on yet which I will do tomorrow, think it's about $2000 and I also have my tools I bought for my last job which I can sell for $1500 since I don't really need them at my new gig.

So yeah, just a good ground place to start would be amazing.",1

t3_bzd9jy,[TX] SIMPLE IRA question - New events with employer who doesn't want to pay you but totally isn't firing you - turns out he wasn't matching retirement contributions either.,"This didn't get any traction on /r/legaladvice so I'm crossposting.

For the background on my wife's situation, read here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bh03ns/tx_wife_just_found_out_her_employer_is_not_paying/

Just give a little update, she left the next day after that post, filed for unemployment and wage claims.

He (employer) contested unemployment, we appealed and gave our side, and it was granted no problem.

He contested the wage claims too, but that process will likely take months from what I understand.

Anyways on to the question - we were tipped off by another leaving employee that SIMPLE IRA matching contributions stopped at the beginning of this year. If you're not familiar with rules for this type of account [here you go](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/simple-ira-plan-faqs-contributions) but the relevant info is that employers *must legally* make a match, which to date they have done the 3% match.

I went back and looked at the account statement and sure enough, only our 3% contribution has been made since January but NOT the 3% match as is required. So we're currently out that money as well as interest.

So my question this time is...as far as pursuing the money goes, is there a process separate from the initial wage claim? Is this a new, *separate* wage claim?

Also, since he's not in compliance with this type of retirement account's rules, should I / can I report this to any authority? Should we be informing the investment company (OppenheimerFunds) of what happened?",1

to book me for twice/week for the next months. I asked how much my portion
would be be AFTER insurance and they were thinking somewhere between $100 and $200.

I tried calling their billing office and was on hold now less than 20 minutes for each of three calls.

So, I waited and got back to my elliptical at home.

In the first week of May, I got theses expenses

PHYSICAL THERAPY - GENERAL CLASSIFICATION   1,740.44

PT THERAPEUTIC EXER 15 MIN x3 - 73410000021 553.53

This works out to more than $773/hour ... This is not open heart surgery or brain surgery but ""rubber bands, rubber balls and
some stairs""

I confirmed with the hospital these are the correct fees and this is what the market is charging.

My insurance agreed this was gouging and only paid $700 leaving me with $1000 to pay.

I went with a medical billing advocacy company named CoPatient. The hospital again did not pick up initially and finally picked up for CoPatient. When they finally got somebody who could give an answer, they said they cant negotiate because insurance had already paid. 

I found insurance paid before I got the hospital bill.

This smells like a rat. Everybody's hand are in each other's  pockets.

But it doesn't stop there. When questioning various people in the billing dept, and quite frankly anybody who would listen, the first comment is ""Insurance pays for that, right?"" ... $773/hour for physical therapy? ... I even had one of their billing reps say my insurance was not that good as they should have paid for more?

Where does this stop? The can keep doubling their bills, insurance pays the old amount but increases their premiums and we end having to pay a bigger and bigger difference each year. The laws are so tight now that these ""hospitals"" will go right to collections and then you can kiss your premium credit score goodbye.

Anybody run into this before?

t3_bzd0bn,How to leverage external job offer for internal raise when the external offer is out of state?,"I have a job offer for 20k more than what I'm making now, doing basically the same thing. Would truly be a lateral move, but for 20k more in salary. COL is comparable in both places, and I'm willing to move. I would rather stay in my current location because moving is a hassle, but not a hassle worth losing out on a 20k pay bump is.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I straight up just tell my employer hey I've got this offer letter for 20k, match it and I'll stay? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really want to tell my current employer that the offer is from out of state in case they want to use it as leverage to try and get me to stay for less money. If they ask to see the offer letter to verify the salary increase, can I mark out the location/name of the company, or do you think that might raise eyebrows and questions?

I am willing to move so if it ends up being that inquisitive of a conversation I can just tell them the truth and hope for the best but thought I could get some advice from you folks here.",1
t3_bzczhs,"Consolidating debt, which of my 9 cards to close?","Good morning! Long time listener first time caller, posting from mobile on a throwaway blah blah.

I just acquired a debt consolidation loan to combine the expiring promo balances from my credit cards and get this shit paid off. Not sure how much it matters to this question, but it's $11,600 at 12.99% for 36 months.

So now I have 9 credit cards with a total credit line of over $50,000. It seems like too much to me, and I want to minimize this a bit. I'm not concerned about the risk of reincurring debt at all. It just feels like 9 cards is too much to manage. Should I close some of these cards? Which are going to be the least detrimental to my credit score? I'm currently in the 750s and would love to bump closer to 800 and maintain that.

All of these cards have a zero balance, so I'm listing the current credit line in order of opening date.


AmEx $11000 since 2008 (my first card)

BofA Visa $900 since 2008/9

GAP card $1600 since 2008/9

Target credit card $2000 since 2013

Firestone CFNA card $2000 since 2014

Citi card $9100 since 2015

Discover card $10500 since 2015

Credit union MasterCard $10000 since 2017

IKEA Visa card $1500 since 2019


I won't be closing the Target, GAP, or Firestone cards because I use them for benefits/rewards. I can take or leave the IKEA card (opened it to get $25 off a purchase, haven't used it since, don't have money to shop at IKEA right now anyway). 

Which of the other 5 cards should I close, if any? I was thinking I'd dump the Citi, Discover, and Visa (I loathe BofA and it's also my lowest credit limit card so mostly useless but I've had it for over 10 years so longevity). I don't want to get rid of the AmEx because it would destroy my longevity average. And I also don't want to close my credit union credit card account.

t3_bzcy89,Need FASFA Help! Dealt with financial abuse from parents,"My mom has done my fasfa and handled my financial aid all throughout my 4 years of college. I graduated last month, and I plan to leave and go NC. I have access to my FASFA account and see that I owe $19k in loans.

t3_bzcpep,GAP insurance is not covering 100% of loan remainder.,"I purchased the vehicle for 21k and made 27 payments getting it down to 15k before mine was totaled. There were no witnesses or red light cameras for the crash, and the other driver lied about running a red light. My insurance paid out 10.9k after a 500 deductible. This left me with 4.5k on the loan. 

I sent the paper work to my gap company that I had on hand, and had to wait a week for the finance company (capitol one) to send their end. The finance company then requested me to fax my  paperwork (police report, insurance stuff) to them so they could work with the gap company. When I had started this the gap company (assurantgap.com) did not have a website or a way to interact with them. There was an 800 number on my finance contract that informed me to send a list of paperwork to a PO Box, but my finance company assured me they would handle it.

I anticipated a month or so for this process to complete, but nothing got done for over two months and after multiple calls to the finance company I became so frustrated I called the 800 number for the gap company again planning to send a letter to their PO box. When I called they now had a message referring me to a website which had an area to do an automated claim with the ability to upload documents etc and a customer service number. I checked with the finance company one last time and they told me it was stuck on waiting for police report, even though I supplied it to both parties.

The Gap company processed everything in less than a week and sent out the check, but it was for only $3750. They are claiming there is a difference in extra interest from late payments. I did have two that were legitimately late and accrued 18 dollar late fees, but every other payment was within the 10 day grace period and only late a day or two. I was told even though it is in the grace period it is still late and accrues extra interest, and they are trying to tell me that adds up to an extra $700+ over two years that they are not liable for. Does that sound correct? The finance company told me they will send me a buyout offer once they receive the check. If they come back wanting that $700+ out of pocket to clear the loan, do I have any recourse? I of course will try to negotiate based off them dropping the ball and leaving me hanging for two months. Nothing in the original gap contract or finance contract say anything about a per Diem interest accruing for payments made within the 10 day grace period.",1

t3_bzcj6f,Commuter / 3rd Car Math,"Hey all - I need your help thinking about the math on a commuter car / 3rd car. This isn't a traditional commuter car eval - I'm not trying to save money (just trying not to lose it!). 

**Background:** I currently own a 2018 Tundra. My truck is a point of major happiness for me. It brings me a lot of joy.  It costs a lot, but it's my happy place. Also, we have a good sized family and use it for road trips, hauling stuff, towing etc. I also feel like I don't get to use it like I want to use it - off-roading, limited wheels/tire options because it's my daily driver etc. Also, I feel like i'm putting useless miles on it by taking it to for random useless errands around town (live in the country so everything's far away). Point being - I don't want to sell it. I want to keep it. 

**Purpose of Exercise:** Analyze impact of 3rd car with the goal of essentially breaking even.

**Math:** The driving factor for savings is essentially the differential between the variable cost to operate the Tundra vs the sedan. 

* I average about 20k miles a year, 15k of those are commute-related (60mi/day). 
* My variable cost to operate Tundra is $0.34/mi. Per Manheim MMR, my truck depreciates at about $0.14/mi (can provide specifics). Gas is about $0.20/mi ($3/gal / 15MPG avg).  
* I can buy a 2009 Toyota Camry Manual Transmission with 92k miles for $9.5k OTD. Need a sedan since 2 boys will be in car at least 1x day. Assuming I finance it over 4 years @ 3.5%, I would pay $700 interest. 
* The Camry cost to operate is about $0.17/mi = $0.10 in fuel ($3gal/31 MPG) + $.07/depr ($9.5k OTD - $3k salvage over 100k remaining miles - assuming 200k useful life). 
* Commute would be 15k/mi year w/ 5k miles on Tundra. 
* Assuming fixed cost to cover would be $15.6k, or: 
   * Principal + Interest on Camry = $10,200 ($9.5k OTD + $700 interest) 
   * Salvage Value = ($3,000)
   * Repairs / maintenance = $3,000
   * Insurance = $5,400 
* Break-even point would be 90k miles on Camry -&gt; $15.6k cost to cover / ($0.34/mi Tundra - $0.17/mi Camry). At 15k/mi year, I would break even in about 5.8 years. Since I plan to keep until 200k miles and it has 100k miles, this seems very plausible. 

**Analysis:** To me, the intangibles are just as important as the #s. Yes, the #s might show that I could break-even. But at what subjective cost? On the one hand, I would get to enjoy my truck much more and could do what I want with it. We could own it for a longer time w/o having to worry about replacing it with another one in the foreseeable future. It gives us more options for a better 3rd car in the future after truck is paid off and wife needs a new vehicle. Also, it slows down the rate of usage on my truck. If circumstances change and we have to sell it, it would improve the value I could get on the truck if I had to sell it. But on the other hand, I will be driving an old Camry for at least 10 hours a week, or 520 hours a year in ATL traffic for the next 6 years and putting my precious cargo in a less safe car. Is it worth it? I think that's what I'm struggling with right now.

**Feedback:** What are your thoughts on this? Is my calculation correct? Are there assumptions I'm leaving out? Any constructive feedback to help my analysis would help.",1

My plan is to use a card solely for wedding purchases in order to track expenses. The card would be paid off in full each month. I would like to find a card that offers rewards that we can use to offset honeymoon costs. I'm not sure if I should use a traditional cash back card or opt for a travel rewards card. I know it sounds obvious to use a travel card, but I've only used cash back cards so I am unfamiliar with how points can be redeemed with travel cards. I'd like to heard some general advice if you've done this before or if you use a certain card and love the rewards program.

I lean toward a traditional cash back card due to how the points are earned. With travel cards, it appears you earn the most points when booking travel. With a cash back card, I can earn points on every day things like gas, groceries, etc.. We travel maybe 3-4 times a year (usually 1 flight and stay in air bnb). If I end up liking the card, I'd like to keep it open after the wedding and use it as our joint account card.

It looks like we are finally meeting this week and I can’t tell if they’ve been dragging their feet or our organization just works slow like this.

I don’t know if the numbers I’m calculating with are off, so maybe someone could help me.
Online I saw that a rough estimate is that you can expect a property to gross you 1% of its value. This seemed accurate as we have a $220K property that would gross us about $2100 monthly if we rented all the units.
I then used a mortgage calculator, assuming 20% down and a rate of 4.2% to calculate mortgages for some differing price points.
I assumed that property management fees would be 10%, as this is the standard I’ve seen.
I estimated that annual repairs would be 1% of annual value per a recommendation online.
Income tax I usually round to 25%z
That being said, if I bought a $1,000,000 income property for example, grossing $10,000monthly, and losing $1000 to management fees, $2500 to income tax, $4820 to a mortgage, and $833 to repairs, that would leave me with a measly $847 profit each month.

According to KBB, I owe more on my car than what I could reasonably get for it, even with a private sale.  It's about 25% more owed than what it's worth. My loan's interest rate is currently 10.29%. I'd like to upgrade to a newer car in the next 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Is my best avenue to go through my credit uniion and refinance this car first at a lower rate, pay it down more, and THEN go through the credit union again to see what kind of a loan they can help with? I'm hoping to take advantage of the end-of-year auto buying. This was my thought, just wondered if it would be smarter just to try to pay down the loan as it is instead of hitting my credit again to refinance.",1
t3_bzbm6q,Freelancer tax issues (IRS says I owe the same amount of money - TWICE?),"I'm a freelance designer in NYC. For the past two years, I've been paying a CPA in LA to file my taxes.

2017 was the first year I filed with him, no problem. I fill out the spreadsheets he gives me and send over my W2s. I got a hefty return and was happy. But shortly after, he contacted me saying that the IRS said I owed a little over $2,300 in taxes for unreported income in 2016. Sure enough, while I had not been full-time freelancing then, there were a few side jobs that I'd neglected to report. So in May of last year I filed an amended return for the year 2016 and added some expenses hoping to offset some of that liability.

Months went by and I hadn't heard anything about the amended return, so I reached out to my accountant to ask. He said not to worry, sometimes these things just take a while and that he would be in touch when he heard anything. 

I let that lie until I filed my 2018 return this year. CPA said I should expect to get $3,200 back from the IRS. Instead, I get $675. I contact him about this. He checks my refund status, and it says: ""your refund has been reduced due to pay a past due IRS tax obligation.""

Now, $3,200 minus $675 is $2,525 - not far off the amount I still owed from 2016. I asked my CPA if this could be the past due balance. (If so, that's fine, I just don't want to keep owing money!) He said he would check with the IRS and get the breakdown.

Then a week later, he emails me separately to say ""the IRS came back with a final adjustment for your 2017 tax return and you owe $2,583 now based on their changes. Do you want to pay that in in full or set up installments?""

I am so confused now. I already paid $2,525 by having it taken out of my tax return. Now it seems like he is saying that I owe close to that number yet again. And I never got a response on my amended 2016 return. I feel like I am not getting the full picture. I've asked for all of my documents from this guy so I can take them to someone else. But I'm curious if any of you Redditors have an idea as to what is going on, or what I should be looking for. I feel overwhelmed and confused by this tax stuff.

Thanks in advance for any insight.",1
t3_bzbkti,Should you Buy Car Out of Budget if you Save Up Enough for Down Payment?,"This is something I was thinking about the other day because I recently leased my first car at 22 years old. I know that there’s some rules like the 20/4/10 rule that a lot of people use for personal finance when it comes to buying a car. I wanted to hear people’s opinions on here of buying a car that’s out of your price range, but you saved up enough specifically for it to keep the monthly payments at or below 10% of monthly income. So for example you put something like 35% down after saving up for it, and then your monthly payments still are as low as having a cheaper car. What would be wrong with this besides the fact that having a nice car isn’t really super important and insurance is probably a little pricier?",1

My parents said it would be hard to get a loan this year from the bank but they could easily get it next year. However, if they do want to get this house and have that loan right now, they would need my name along with theirs???

I just got notified by my bank about a recent inquiry for my credit report so I’m guessing that the house deed or mortgage loan might be under my name.

t3_bzb4kc,I feel upfront cost of buying is the biggest barrier to saving money. How do people do it?,"I'm in my late 20's and am one of those people who has their stuff together (no debt, good career) and know where I'd like to stay for the foreseeable future. My SR is 50% but I'm losing out on building equity by renting. But the upfront cost prevents me from immediately buying in the first place (I can certainly afford the mortgage with ease) and I'm effectively dumping money down the drain by renting. 

I live in a city with relatively low cost of living - rent with bills for a 1 bedroom apartment is 30% of my takehome - and my savings rate is 50% living a modest lifestyle. Even though property is relatively affordable for a city this size, the upfront cost to buy a 2 bedroom place (downpayment, duties, etc) requires saving up for 7 years. That means wasting money on rent during the same time period, that would have paid for 20% of the property's value.

I've done the calculations for another city that I'd consider living in (it's more expensive overall, but also pays better and has more career doors) and assuming there's also rent that needs to be paid, the upfront cost for buying also requires saving up for 10-ish years.

Since the upfront cost is basically an amount not covered by a home loan, I will be 30-35 before I can even think about buying, not counting price inflation and I've already had a head-start of sorts being debt-free since graduation.

The only options I see are to partner up and get married (halving rent, reducing income tax and increasing combined income), live with parents/relatives if they're willing and/or get a family/friend loan on the upfront cost. Are these really my only options to speed up the route to stop wasting money on rent and building equity?",1

t3_bz4ji3,"Newly married, need mortgage and home owner advice","Hello PF,

I'm newly married and currently living in Maine. I'm 31 and my wife is 32. Before we got engaged she moved to Maine for a great job opportunity and I soon followed. Before I joined her, she purchased a condo by herself. I am not on the loan or anything, but we did split the mortgage from day one. 

Now that our finances are completely combined, is it a good idea for us to add myself to the loan and property info or does being married automatically attach me legally? We plan on purchasing a house in the near future (either in Maine or Massachusetts) and was wondering if I would be eligible for 'first time home buyers' programs. Does being married to a homeowner affect that? If I am added to the loan, will that disqualify me from eligible programs?

t3_byji2n,PLEASE take some time to understand your benefits at work,"I'm a federal employee and you wouldn't believe how often I encounter people who have no idea how any of our benefits work. The most common I see are:

* People find out they (or their federal employee spouse) are pregnant and want to know how much maternity leave we get (answer: NONE)
* They think FMLA is 12 weeks of PAID leave - this is disturbingly common
* Then they want to know how they can get short-term disability after the baby is born (answer: that's not a benefit the government gives you - you would have had to enroll before now)
* They want to know how the leave bank works (many agencies have this) and are shocked when they find out they would have had to already be contributing to it in order to draw from it
* They have no idea how our retirement savings (TSP) work - have either not been contributing since they started employment, or are contributing a little but have never adjusted the allocation beyond the government bond fund that all new enrollees are in

Secondly, would it make much of a difference? The only benefits I can think of are that (1) I would pay less tax on my investments (would I?), and (2) I would just rather invest through something like an LLC, and keep it separate from my personal accounts, for the sake of keeping it organised.

t3_bzaird,Should I look into opening a new credit card to help credit age average in the future? (Young account),"Hi! Some possibly helpful background: 

I’m a soon to be college grad with 2 credit cards: 1. BoA Cash Rewards, Almost 4 years old 2. Target card, 1 year old. 

I‘ve used my BoA card in lieu of a debit card since opening it. (I think I used it so much that my credit limit was increased without request from 1,000 to 4,000 the day before Black Friday a year into opening the account. I spent a lot that Friday.) Anything I buy that’s not at Target, I use this card and pay it off in full each month. I don’t have any debts or student loans. 

I tried opening a Costco Citi card about a year ago and was denied because of a lack of credit history or low score (though my FICO score has averaged 750, though has fluctuated from 780-740 every now and then—I assume the high score is result of the thin file effect? Or something like that?). Today I finally made a credit karma account and saw that the average of my credit age is low because of the two cards I have. 

So to the actual question at hand, should I look into opening a new credit card now to lower average today but let it all age together or just open another card further down the line and take a hit to the average in the future? Or should I just stick with what works and keep my card count at 2? If it’s recommended I open a new card, what card do you suggest? And even then, how do y’all recommend balancing the use of multiple cards?

t3_bzai0q,Truck That Was Offered vs Buying a New Car,"So I'm going to start driving soon, and my grandpa has kept a 2007 Silverado for me since I was in high school (22 now), he took it back from his son which is how he got it. He drove it for awhile, put it in storage and told me that when I was ready to drive it's mine. 

Now that I'm finally learning how to drive,  he's giving me a choice between the truck and 3k to put towards a new vehicle, and he would drive the truck if I take the money. He's run his vehicle into the ground, and it needs repairs, hence why he'd be driving the Silverado instead, at least until it gets fixed.

I'm leaning towards taking the money, the truck has a little over 110k on it, a few minor things wrong with, but as far as I can tell runs just fine, and he needs to be able to safely get around anyways, my question is whether or not I'm screwing myself in the long run. I never planned to buy a new car for my first vehicle, always used so it isn't like I haven't thought about it, but I don't want to end up on the losing side of this if I can help it. He's said that I can still use it if I need to get work, or if I go out and he doesn't need it etc., so it isn't like I'm necessarily out of a vehicle, at least temporarily, but I'm still stuck thinking it over.

Based on my monthly contributions and employer match, I'm on track to reach the $3500 individual contribution limit this year. My questions are:        

   

1. What if my expenses/payments deplete the fund? I can't make any additional tax-deductible contributions right?     
2. Is there a way for me to set up post-tax contributions once I reach the limit? Or is my only option to set up a separate account that pulls a certain amount from my checking each payday?

 

To be honest, I don't have much in savings at the moment because I prioritized paying off student loans and was naive enough to think I wouldn't need a significant rainy day fund any time soon. I pretty much forgot I had a balance in the HSA (out of sight, out of mind, right?) but once I saw this bill, I was DEFINITELY glad to have it because idk how else I would have paid for these initial expenses.

I have a high deductible plan and fully anticipate that my upcoming treatments/appointments this year will result in my total out of pocket medical expenses far exceeding the $3500 limit.

t3_bza1e6,Life Insurance if you're older and not well?,"I'm 58 and my health isn't great, I have a few chronic conditions.I have no assets or life insurance anymore and I'm wondering if there's any way I can get some insurance, just so the kids have something if the treatment I'm going through doesn't help and I die within a decade.20 years ago I went thru an ugly divorce with a man who had a secret abusive side. He made my life very difficult even after I left him—stalking, harassing, turning friends and family against me. He's very convincing and some of them are way bigger arseholes than I could ever have imagined before we hit hard times.We had 2 kids. I bought a house for us when I left my husband, put 100k into it and the mortagage was manageable with me working part-time. We should have been okay except that my youngest got bone cancer. The treatment was very long and drawn out, even after 10 years we were still having operations. I spent a very long time in hospital with him, sleeping on a fold-out chair—I had to give up work and I lost my house and my own health suffered. My family wouldn't help; I don't see them anymore. My child lived, thank god.

Re my house: my father and his wife put in 1/5, and my husband put in another 1/5. I had 3/5. I fell way behind on mortgage payments when my son was diagnosed and I had no income, and they basically arranged amongst themselves to sell it to my father's wife for less than we paid for it. I was devastated but way too caught up with a dying child to do much. I really never thought they would leave us homeless and with no assets, but they did. My father has since died, leaving us nothing, and his wife still owns my house. She is a lawyer and a real estate investor, has several properties but she likes to cry poor. She won't help. This was 10 years ago now so I doubt I have a legal recourse, anyway, she's a very good lawyer, lol. Nothing comes between that one and a buck.

But now I have a good flat with a decent rent that hopefully will be long-term. My only income is from occasional writing and a welfare pension but we can live comfortably on that. If I get a bit better I could make more from writing—probably.

My eldest (22) has just started a full-time, decently paid job and is living with us for now—he came home from a different city where he was at uni, he's cut back uni to part time. He'll probably want to move out in a few months but wants to save some money. He's good with budgeting, but I do need him to contribute to the bills now he's earning. I still want him to be able to save, though.  


I had a good career, but these circumstances cut into it, and it's not possible for me to return, I'm too far out of the loop with the technology and not well enough to work. I do some writing on my good days and get paid for political articles sometimes.  


The younger one (20) has just finished with his operations and is now looking at uni, has occasional casual work, and wants to stay living with me. He's an artist and doesn't want a career outside or that, though my oldest is more ambitious. I am going to try to get the youngest on the lease so if anything happens to me the flat lease goes to him: it's a really valuable thing to have as my city is unbelievably expensive, and we were basically homeless for 2 years while he was still being treated. I hope and believe the tenancy can be very long-term.

Their father has some money; he's about to retire and sell his city home which is worth about 2-3 million. I've suggested to the boys that they ask him to give them their inheritance from that so they can put it into property now. We've talked about buying a house in the country not too far from the city, to ensure we always have a home. Our days without a home have made us very conscious and fearful of that situation. I would move to the country if the boys did that.

They see the sense in the idea, but they're not very comfortable with asking him. He has a lovely adult daughter from another relationship, and his current wife has an adult son, so that's 4 kids with a claim to an inheritance.

I just want to be able to let the boys have something when I die. Life insurance is the only thing I can think of, but I worry that my health will make it way too expensive, or even impossible.  
We live in Australia, btw.

t3_bz0oo2,Should we refinance our mortgage if we bought one year ago? (US),"Hi!

Our mortgage broker is pressuring us to refinance. I'm not sure if it's a great idea. 

We bought in April of 2018. We paid 375,000 for a 2 bed/2.5 bath townhouse with a 1 car garage. We're in Northern CA. 

We put 5% down with a 4.625% interest rate. Our Payment is $2659.58 including our HOA

&amp;#x200B;

Our broker gave us an analysis to refinance at 3.875% interest.  This would bring our payment down to $2381.34 including our HOA. So a savings of $278 per month. Half of this savings comes from a lower PMI. We don't have the money for the closing costs, he is saying we could roll the closing costs into the loan if we get a high enough appraisal.. 

Our property may or may not have gone up in value. (A similar home in our complex without a garage just sat on the market for 6+ months and finally sold for $335,000) 

My husband was not expecting to refinance so soon and has a problem with spending.  He just took out a $18,000 loan to pay off his credit cards.  We keep separate finances and each pay half of our bills, so I had no idea he had racked up so much debt. I assumed he was paying for things with the overtime he was working. (I'm going to be taking over his finances from now on to try to help him get this under control).

Our debt to income ratio is not great. He has a $400 loan payment, a $300 car payment. I just have a $150 car payment. We made $110K last year combined. I'm not sure we would qualify for a lower rate at this point. 

We just had a baby 5 months ago and this seems very overwhelming. 

I'm not sure if this is enough info but do you have any advice?

Edit: he let us know closing would be less than 4k! We would pay $600 for the appraisal and the rest would be financed. If the estimated savings is accurate we would recoup the closing costs in a little over a year. We plan on keeping this home as a rental of we ever decide to move",1

Unlike the private sector that grade increase is almost certainly going to stick if I stay within the government, so has real value in terms of where I can go in my career in the future.",1

t3_bz6s04,How were fraudulent authorized users added to credit card? (US),"Help, r/personalfinance! My wife and I recently discovered a few fraudulent transactions on her credit card.

t3_bz30fl,Lease vs buy situations,"I’m trying to explain to a friend why leasing is bad and I’m actually failing at it lol. 

Lease: down payment, monthly payment, assuming you stay in the mileage limitations. So you know your cost for the lease term. The lease states what the buyout amount will be at the end of the term (can that change). 

Buying: calculate over all cost of loan. 

Is that all of the factors to calculate total cost of lease vs loan?",1

t3_bz9fe7,Resources to Plan for Parent's Retirement,"Hi All -

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone come across any books / services / tools that have helped you help your parents with retirement? My parents are  approaching retirement age and I don't believe they have enough saved to live comfortably. I'd like to start planning but I have no idea how to incorporate social security, medicare, elder care, etc. into my cost assumptions.

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What type of public benefits will be available as they age (e.g. SS, medicare.medicaid, etc.) and where can I get info on specifics?
2. What costs will not be covered by public benefits? (e.g. elder care??)
3. What are some creative ideas for helping them generate income? (For example, we're thinking of buying a multi-unit property where rent can be used to subsidize their income once we pay off mortgage. Has anyone else done this?)

&amp;#x200B;

***Parents:***

64 &amp; 63

Combined Income: $20K.  (Normally around $110K but my Dad hasn't been able to work over the last year so they are relying on my Mom's  salary.)

Costs: They live in a high cost area but are pretty frugal

Combined Savings: $750,000 (All 401K)

Other Assets: I believe their home is worth $450K and they share a car

Debt: I don't know but I think it's  sizable. Maybe $80K mortgage, $90K for sister's school loans, they recently took out a 2nd mortgage on their home for reasons I don't understand, etc.

Health Care: Mom plans to work until my Dad is 64.5 so that they have health insurance. At that point, they can access Medicare.

Note:  My Mom has been struggling with  health issues and my Dad has essentially stopped working as a result. I worry that they're vulnerable to poor financial choices at the moment. Assuming no catastrophes, I think my parents will have enough to meet their basic needs once SS kicks in.

But I want them to do more than meet basic needs. I'd like for them to have a fun retirement! Assuming that a ""comfortable retirement"" is $70K and that they will  draw $2K in SS and 3% off their 401K, then we're looking at a **$23K/ year shortfall** between what they will earn (without reducing 401K principal) and what they would need. I'm assuming they need to sell house in a few years to repay debt and will net $0.",1
t3_bz66wq,How do I get a delinquent bill that’s not mine removed from my credit?,"It belongs to my dad for a water bill he missed back in 2016 and since we both have the same name they mistakenly put it on my credit. I wasn’t paying for water and still don’t and I was only 16 going on to 17 at the time. 

We called the collection agency and explained everything to them then they said that the only way it can be removed is if my dad pays for it....keep in mind I used my own social security number, my one and only SSN to open my account back in 2017 it’s my own bank account I don’t share it with my father he has his own so there’s no reason for it to be on my credit. 

I told the collector again that I’m not responsible for the bill and I need it removed off my credit and she told me again that my dad needs to pay for it first before they go ahead and do that. 

Why can’t they just put it on my dads credit? This can ruin my chances of joining the service which I’m trying to do and get a house on my own.

t3_bz3u86,Need advice. GFs parents want to contribute to downpayment of condo/townhouse.,"I’ve (25 yo) been pensive ever since my girlfriend (25 yo) relayed to me what they talked about recently.

She relayed to me that instead of finally moving in together by renting an apartment or condo, her parents want to contribute to a downpayment to a condo/townhouse. This seems great on the surface but I’m hesitant and don’t know how to take it.

t3_bz5og9,Please help me figure out how to get out of this terrible financial situation me and my family are in.,"*TLDR/Recap below*
I’m 19 (last born) and I live with my Dad (52), my mom(47), and my oldest sister (27). I just graduated and am already “technically” hired at my local Dollar General store (I am setup to do their online training starting Wednesday morning then have my first shift Friday morning.) It’s also the best option for a job in my small town. I have no credit history at the moment, my mom and dad’s is at least somewhere around Poor or worse. We have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee with 250K miles on it that works well enough to work currently but has started having some problems. We rent a place for $700 a month and the landlords are luckily the more lenient and understanding type (and were not moving for the foreseeable future btw), currently the place works good enough for us and our 6 huskies.
Here’s where the problems start: my dad has worked basically all his life about 30-35 years straight, but he just got a knee replacement and is scheduled for the other knee replacement for a few months from now so he won’t be going back to work for at the very least 6-9 months, he really needs them but of course it cuts big time into our income for now. He can’t get unemployment because PA has the dumbest rules about it I’ve ever heard. He can’t work and should be eligible but isn’t because apparently they expect him to work on one leg (yes I’m still pissed about it). Anyway, my Mom can’t work at all because she is permanently injured/disabled  from a car accident and she can’t file for Disability because she still lives with us and they will automatically disqualify her because my sister and Dad (when he was working) had an income and she needs some help with everyday stuff so she stays with us. My sister just works, that’s about it with her.

So here’s a TLDR/recap:
(We get about $450 a month in Food Stamps)
My Mom- can’t work since she is permanently injured/disabled.
My Sister- makes $10.30 an hour working an average of 4-5 days a week doing a 12 hour shift as a gate-guard for a gas company.
My Dad- is out of work temporarily for at least another 6-9 months due to a knee replacement he just had done last month and the other one he’ll have done in a few months. Can’t get unemployment. (He used to make over $10 an hour and usually got 5 days a week working at the same company as my sister does when he was working.) 
Me-I will be making $7.50 an hour Part Time (for now) as a sales associate at my local Dollar General, likely start my first shift Friday morning.

Our budget/debt:
-Gas per week (Appts and work): About $100
-ISP bill: $175 current bill
-Electric: $900 past due
-Gas: $400 past due/current bill:$115
-DirecTV: $275 total/$99 suspension 6/14
-Geico: $51 per month
-Storage: $53 per month
-Rent: $200 left to pay for May + $700 due for June at the end of the month.
-Cell Phones: currently shut off and account sent to collections.
[Had to let some bills go/pile up like our cell phones, Electric, and Gas a little bit.]
-NO Credit Card debt.
At this moment we have the bare essentials food wise; a few loaves of bread, a pack of bologna and ham, eggs, 1 box of cereal, milk, coffee, and water. Luckily we get stamps on Wednesday. Regardless, I am tired of living literally paycheck to paycheck. It has gotten gradually worse over the past year or so. The most depressing thing is walking out and seeing my dad just holding his head in his hands feeling helpless. I am depressed, my sister has been diagnosed too. The best I could get job wise is working Part Time (for now, no timetable yet for when I’ll be full time) for $7.50 an hour working right around 20 hours a week and I feel like it still won’t be enough. I just don’t really know what else to do at this point. I wanted to try to do monthly payments on a pre owned/used car in really good shape through a friend who works at a dealership but the cheapest car I could get is $150-$175 a month and IF I work exactly 20hrs a week then I make exactly $150 but that’s before any taxes or anything like that so I don’t think I could even do that right now and would have to wait until my manager says I can work full time.

t3_bz6yn7,Will getting a cosignature from someone of equal credit standing help lower rates of an auto loan?,"I’m looking to replace my car - I’ll be putting down $5,000 and financing the remaining $16,000. 

My credit is good, 755-765 from FICO and Experian, but I only have about 5 years of credit history, and all of it is just two/three credit cards and a small auto loan of about $7,000 that is paid off. 

My fiancé has a similar credit rating and similar credit card history, but no auto loan. Neither of us have ever missed a payment and utilization is around 10-15% each. 

If he co-signs/co-borrows(?) for the loan, will that do anything for lowering the rates? If not are there any other positives like will it help us in the future if we both have an auto loan on our credit report when we go to buy a house, or anything like that? 

He’s already agreed to co-sign and he knows what that means and that he’d be responsible for the loan if I died or just said fuck it and made him pay and there’s no issue there, were just wondering if there’s any benefit.

t3_bz8o3z,Negotiating extension on lease; offbeat proposal from landlord,"This is a bit of an odd situation; hoping for your thoughts. I’m moving states soon and my current lease ends on a date when I will be in a completely different location for a nonnegotiable event. My choices are to move out a week ahead of the event or a week later, and I greatly prefer the latter option. 

I asked my landlord for an extension on my current lease, assuming they would want me to pay some kind of premium. Instead, they asked me to find a new tenant to take on a new lease with them.

Does this sound weird to anyone else? I understand putting that burden on a tenant who is trying to break a lease, but I’ve never heard of a landlord asking a tenant to find someone to enter into a whole new lease with them. I told them I needed to think about it, so the specifics are still up in the air. 

The way they made it sound, their concern is that it gets more difficult to find tenants as summer ends. But if that’s the case, why would I be any better at it? Why even entertain my request at all? I mean, if I did manage to find a new tenant, then that person would be on a yearlong lease right after me, so they would have the same problem with the timing a year from now. I’m thinking that the real reason they made this proposal is because they’re having difficulties finding tenants on their own. There are a number of vacant apartments right now, and they’re doing showings all the time. Maybe they’re just angling to outsource their own work. 

Any ideas about how I should respond? I should note that the landlord told me that this proposal was just to “start the conversation,” but I have no idea what sort of counteroffer would satisfy them. Should I just offer to pay an increased rate and see if they take it?",1

t3_bz8n6d,Services and procedures showing as fully paid with deductible not met?,"Ok, this might be a little bit long but I want to cover all the details. I had an HSA account and a HDHP with $5k deductible, $6500k max. I was finally able to keep a years worth of money in the HSA so I can meet the maximums. My wife ended up having a procedure (colonoscopy) and then needed an MRI and other testing. The doctor gave us the number to setup the appointments and we asked about the cash price and with our insurance. Well the office told us prices and we called the insurance and they said since our deductible hasn’t been met if she goes within 10 days and not pre-register we are entirely responsible. Well her doctor decided this needed to happen within 24-48 hours and it cannot wait. They said they are going to call the insurance right away. A few minutes later we get a call from the insurance that said, you are approved and can go any time within the next 30 days. So fast forward we have the appointments, I intend on getting a large bill but will pay with my HSA (as planned) but now all the bills are coming in and it shows the cost, the discount and what the insurance paid and it shows me at zero balance due and they paid it in full. As much as I’m happy to see that I’m also falling inti the mindset of “too good to be true” So to get my mind as ease I call the insurance directly and have the EoB available and they cannot explain why it’s zero. All I’m told is that it was paid in full. 

I should note in the past the online records have said different things in the past, it originally said I owed nothing then log on days later and it has an updated balance of what I owe. The difference this time is I have a physical print out.

My assumptions (total guess) is when the doctor called the insurance they coded it different? Maybe as preventative or something? Our plan offers preventative care and routine check ups at no cost, so maybe this qualified?? 

My last question is, if I have these documents that say zero can they charge me later and just say it was an error or something like that?",1

I’ve worked for this organization for almost two years, so that amounts to ~$5,000 that I’ve been underpaid over that time. How do I go about asking for that in backpay? I was too surprised at the impromptu 3 minute-long meeting today to initiate this conversation at the time. Any advice?",1

Then after the lease is up you can purchase the vehicle for the amount of the residual value. Am I wrong on this? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",1

t3_bz527e,Unusual question regarding found travelers checks.,"I’m not sure if there is a better subreddit to ask this question but I figured this would be the best place to get some guidance. 

My girlfriend and I have just recently moved into our first apartment and we given a bunch of old furniture from her grandparents. When cleaning out one of the dresser drawers, under the liner, there was an envelope containing $5,000 in US travelers checks. 

Some of these checks have both lines already signed and some don’t have any signatures on them. 

After talking with my girlfriends grandparents they said that these checks were given to them over 30 years ago by a family friend from Brazil. 

Now we are here wondering, can we cash these? I’m assuming no for the already signed ones, but how about the ones that have no signatures on them?

Last year, she had her own health insurance for the first months (including April).  I added her onto my health insurance beginning in April.

However, I received a 1095-C health insurance form from my employer stating I was covered all 12 months.  It doesn't list her name or any other additional persons anywhere on the form.

She did receive a 1095-A form that we didn't submit originally.

As I began filling out the 8962 form, line 6 says we are not eligible for the premium tax credit.  Why do I need to continue filling out this form in that case?

After that it starts asking about policy and allocation amounts and I don't know what half the terms mean or if they even apply to us at that point.

All I can figure out is there was a mistake somewhere, either my employer should have included her name on my 1095-C form, the IRS thinks she wasn't covered for the remaining 8 months, and/or I don't know why they sent me a premium tax credit form.  I called the IRS twice, they referred me to two separate departments twice.  It's such a convoluted setup, I hate the tax system in this country so much....",1

My employment anniversary is July 25, 2016 so this year marks three years. I **must** start my new job July 29th, no exception.

1--if I leave with no notice, (I have other references at the company) how can that backfire on me that I may not be thinking about? 


 2--do I wait until the 26th to resign so that I was definitely at work on the 25th or can I do it on the 25th since that should count as my last day of employment?

To be clear: IF I do leave with no notice, I will make sure there are continuity files, emails, and instructions for all of my projects and I will do my utmost to make it as least painful as possible.

t3_bz8gt9,"Saving Third of My (23) Income, NOT investing in anything, please help!","Hi everyone. I just turned 23 and just started working around 8 months ago. I make around $3000 a month after taxes (45k a year before taxes), and save about $1000 a month.

Right now, all of this is just going in a savings account. At this point I have about $8500 in a savings account and $2500 in checkings. I figure the saving account acts as my 3-6 month emergency fund. But the question is, where do I go from here.

I'm assuming I should be putting a lot into retirement accounts now, but also there are some major purchases I want to save for as well, so I want to prioritise.

In my area a house costs around $300k, so I'd like to have $60k saved as a downpayment when I'm in my early thirties. I'm driving a beater car right now that will last another year or two, but will probably spend around $10k on a car at around 25 (should be making ~55k by then).

My bank is USAA and I have access to fidelity mutual funds. I don't think my employer offers 401k matching, but I can open a 401k and assuming I probably should. I expect I will be making at least 75k by the time I am 30 on my career path and that's a conservative estimate. 

How much should go in a 401k (money I won't touch until retirement) vs how much should go in savings to go for my major purchases over the next decade (newer car + house).  Should I put half in 401k fidelity mutual funds that I can't touch, and half in non-retirement mutual funds that I can touch when I am ready to buy a home?

Edit: I have no college or major debts (full ride).

t3_bz8gid,Taxes on stock market capital gains/losses,"Hello. I was wondering if someone can verify if i am correct or not in my understanding. And help with some questions I may have. I did couple readings on investopedia.

Looking at perspective of single and filing single.

1. you can move your capital loss deduction to future years. not locked into using it for the tax year you got your loss from.

2. short term capital gains is taxed at normal tax brackets. long term is much less.

3. you can deduct a max of $3000 on capital loss to your total taxable income. meaning if you had a net realized capital loss of $5000, you can apply $1500 in deductions and move $1500 for future deductions (whether that be next year, or 10 years from now)

4. basic strategy in using capital loss deduction is to move you to a lower tax bracket. example assuming 2019 tax bracket is same for next year. lets say someone had a capital loss of $1400. his W2 income is $40,300. meaning $825 gets taxed at 22%. if he applies $825 of his $1400 capital loss, it brings him down to $39,475, or at the very edge of 12% tax rate. effectively putting him in the 12% tax bracket. and he can move his $575 left of capital loss for future use.

am i correct in my understanding?",1
t3_bz4xh0,Buying a house sooner or later... we hate where we live currently and rather than spend a years worth of rent we’re thinking about buying this summer with a smaller % down payment.

We both grew up in this city and despite having plenty of fond memories, were at an age where were done with this city... too much parking, neighbors up your ass, no privacy, cramped spaces, crazy randos all over the neighborhood, etc, etc... we aren’t city people and want to get out ASAP.

I make 135k and own a property I turned into a rental a few years ago. She makes 45k. We are currently renting because we wanted to save up a traditional 20% down payment and our plan was to buy at this time next year... but we are seriously desiring the surrounding suburb counties more and more each day and want to be done with all the bullshit that comes with living in Philly. Our rent is $1,500 a month (full house with backyard) and we currently have 23k saved up... 

I was daydreaming and thought about going to the bank to get pre-approved and then beginning our house hunt this summer with a smaller % downpayment. Our ideal home price is 400k-475k.

We have the following debts remaining
Rental property mortgage: 170k
My student loans: 10k
Her student loans: 17k
Car loan: 9k
Commuter vehicle lease: $250 a month with 1.5 years left on the lease

In the past I viewed 20% as important to get the optimal interest rate, but at the moment with quality of life and unhappiness and a bright career/earning path ahead of me I feel like whatever the consequence of less than 20% would be is worth it compared to the unsatisfactory housing situation  we have now.

t3_bz4vos,"Was lied to by a sales associate at a T-Mobile store about a $20 upgrade fee, can I dispute this with my credit card company?","I’m not sure if this belongs here but didn’t know where else to post:

Apparently this is a common complaint received by T-Mobile customer service. I went in to the T-Mobile store near my home to buy my husband a new Google 3a XL for his upcoming birthday. The phone was advertised for $479 (same price as amazon), so we decided to buy it at the store so that he can start using it today. At this point we are not made aware of any service fees nor did we ask. As the sales associate is ringing us up I noticed briefly the monitor show a sub total of $499 and then it disappeared. When I asked the associate what the discrepancy is, (the phone was advertised as $479 why is it saying $499), he shows me his tablet showing that the phone is in fact ringing up for $479.

I was too lazy to do the math and realize that 7% of $479 should have only totaled to $512.  He then proceeds to tell me that my total is $535 with tax (a $20+tax discrepancy for an upgrade fee that he obviously did not want me to know about). I hand over my credit card and he prints up my receipt and proceeds to FOLD IT UP while telling me about their return policy of 14 days and their restocking fee. 

A couple of hours later I get home, unfold the receipt and noticed a $20 service charge on the itemized receipt. Furious, I called the store and speak to another employee only to find out that the person who sold us the phone and the Manager are both gone for the day and there is nothing he can do for us. I also file a formal complaint with T-Mobile only to be told that there is nothing more they can do for us right now. Can I dispute this with my credit card company? Or is there anything else I should be doing right now?

$20 is not going to break my bank but I am just so upset that this guy lied to my face when I asked him about the $499 subtotal.

t3_bz8ekj,Best way to pay off various forms of debt after college?,"I just graduated with a degree in engineering and I've accepted an offer for a job where I'll be making around $4500 per month after taxes. I'm married with no kids and live in an area with a relatively low cost of living so I can probably put around $2000 per month into my debt. My current debt and approximate interest rates are as follows:

-

$58,000 in student loans at 6%

$13,000 in credit card debt at 25%

$12,500 in auto loans (2 cars) at 7% and 13%

$6,500 in personal loans at 40%

-
I know its bad, especially the personal loans, but I did what I had to do to get through college. My credit score would be in the upper 700s if not for my credit card debt but is currently in the low 600s.

The best idea I have right now is to take the following steps:

1. Pay off $6-7k in credit card debt to improve credit score
2. Get a personal loan at a lower rate to pay off high interest personal loans
3. Refinance higher interest auto loan or both
4. Open 1-2 new credit cards that offer 0% interest for first 12+ months and use those for buying while paying off other cards
5. Pay off loans starting with highest interest rate

During all this I'll be making the minimum possible payments on my student loans, setting aside a few hundred per month for emergencies, and starting to save up for a house. My first priority though is to improve my credit score so I can move my debt to lower interest accounts.

Is this is a solid plan or can anyone offer ideas for improvement? Would it be worth it to hire a financial adviser?",1
t3_bz8cow,Balance Transfer or Loan for my situation,"Hey Personal Finance,



So, prior to my kid being born two years ago, I had a bit of credit card debt.. about $3,500. We were paying it off at a decent rate but just couldn’t get it fully down. 


When my kid was born, my wife stayed home longer than we intended.. and then daycare costs kicked in. Then, my position at work was eliminated due to budgetary constraints, and my new position pays $15,000 less than my previous position. The only good news is my wife and kid are healthy and happy. Financially, it’s felt like one punch after another. Good news is we’ve stabilized our spending.


We are no longer racking up new debt. The credit cards ballooned up to about $18,000 at one point. Over the last few months, we got it down to $14,000. But interest is going to start in a month. 


So here I am, two years into this. I’m on the “cusp” of a promotion which will increase my salary by $45,000. A new position is opening at work and due to my previous position being cut, I’ve been told by superiors I’m next. But I have to wait until April 2020 before anything would officially kick in. In the mean time, I have been heavily interviewing for new positions in other places that would also provide me with this sort of salary bump, but my field is competitive and not very large; this still could take me a year or two to land. 



I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking of doing a balance transfer to US Bank with 20 months no APR and 3% transfer fee or taking out a 14k SoFi loan over four years at 9%. My financial position should change considerably by this time next year, but it’s so hard for me to rely on that and I need some guidance. These people eliminated a position once on me, I haven’t exactly been trusting lately. 


I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts. Thanks for listening.",1
t3_bz0y68,Woman Asking to Take Pictures of Receipts,"Yesterday, while checking out at a grocery store, I saw a woman asking everyone who checked out if they had their receipt, and if she could take a picture of it. She was not a store employee, and seemed a bit erratic. The store employees seemed bothered by her, but not enough to kick her out.

When she asked me if I had a receipt, I lied and said no, then asked why she was asking. She claimed to have an app on her phone that paid her to take pictures of receipts, and claimed she was making $3000 - $5000 a year from doing so. She also claimed this money was going towards buying gifts for her kids birthdays and Christmas gifts.

The whole situation seemed sketchy to me, so I moved along. I went home and did some research, but could not find anyway to make so much money off of taking pictures of other people's receipts. I found some applications that would occasionally pay you for receipt pictures, and other applications like Google Rewards, which will occasionally ask for a receipt after seeing you visit a certain location.

All that said, is this some sort of scam, or is there actually an application out there that will pay you to endlessly take pictures of receipts?

Here's the situation, I received a Subaru as a gift with low mileage. Based on KBB, the car is worth about $14-15k. Let's just say 15k. The car is a 2014 model, and I will need to put some money into maintenance over the 3 years. I estimate about $2k. I know I will for sure have to replace the tires and brake pads, and potentially rotors, and that alone will cost me about 1k already. I will also need to buy a new battery soon, etc. The car will also depreciate. I estimate by the end of 3 years, the car will further depreciate another 4k. So assuming I sell the car for 11k, I end up with 8000 dollars. (11,000 - 2000 maintenance). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now if I were to buy a new car, I could trade in my Subaru and get a 2019 Honda. I've already spoken with some dealerships, and one offered to take my car, and I would only need to pay $6.5k out the door in addition to the trade in. Because the car is brand new, I won't need to replace tires, and brake pads, just basic maintenance like oil changes which won't cost much. Assuming I sell this car in 3 years, I estimate the car will depreciate down to about $15k. So 15k-6.5k = 8500. 

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to keeping the old car, I am up 500 bucks. I know by estimations are rough, but even if I end up 1000 less with the new car, I think it's worth it because I am getting a brand new car with warranty, I don't have to worry about the engine breaking, I get much more safety features such as a back up camera, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I need a car for at least the next 3 years of my life because I will be moving out to California for a job. After those 3 years, I don't know where I will be, so let's just assume I will sell the car in 3 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Am I missing something or is buying the new car a no brainer?",1
t3_bz33b9,"5+ years of sinking credit and collections calls, How do I fix it?","hey all looking for some advice here

late 20's, USA, just came into some money for the first time in my life and want to finally fix my terrible credit but I don't know where to start. To my knowledge the only sources of my outstanding debt are:

a $300 capital one credit card I irresponsibly signed up for in 2013-2014, immediately maxed out and proceeded to ignore until now, as well as

two courses from a local community college that claims I didn't pay (also in the 2013-14 time frame).

I have received hundreds of calls over the years from collectors which I always ignore out of fear (especially when sometimes the numbers appear as my own number almost down to the digit), but which I'm sure relates to the credit card. I don't know if the community college debt has gone to collection as well, but I assume it has after this length of time. I'm ready to finally face the music and pay whatever outstanding amount I owe to get my credit back on course. But I don't know where to start.

Do I just answer the next collection call I get to my phone and cooperate with whatever they tell me?

How do I know that the source of the collection is legitimate? And once I do pay how can I be sure that I won't get any future calls relating to this debt?

After I have figured out how to properly pay off the debt, what is the best way to begin to rebuild my credit? I certainly won't be approved for any kind of credit card for some time. and I have no other regular payments in my name.

t3_bz7vyh,Quarterly Estimated Taxes for a few months of minor income?,"I'm unsure how to / if I need to pay quarterly estimated taxes. (USA)

Here's my situation for 2019:

• Jan-Mar: Normal salaried employee.

• Apr-Present: Quit, then did minor self-employed consulting while taking a few months off.

• Jul/Aug onward: Likely to start a new job soon. Salary should be much lower than before due to new career goals, but I have no idea how by much.

I did as much research as I could but most FAQs on self-employment/quarterly taxes assume I'm running a sizable business with a relatively stable income. If I use my 2018 income/taxes as a guide I will wildly overpay. 

As I'll be going through three different employment situations with very different incomes over the course of the year, I'm incredibly confused as to what I'm estimating against.

• For quarterly period Apr 1 - May 31 my self-employment income was $2k. 

• For whole year I expect self-employment income to total no more than $4-5k. All the rest should be from normal full time employment.

I've seen a lot of sites mention that you only pay quarterly if your liability is going to be over $1k. But $1k of what? Specifically vis a vis self-employment income? I of course won't owe $1k on $2k, tho maybe I might on 5k?

t3_bz46vy,Rewards credit card to pay off HeLoC?,"I am trying to see the flaw in this plan I am formulating.

I will use nice round numbers for everything.

I have a HeLoC with my local credit union: $80k

I have a Chase Sapphire Reserve card with a credit limit: $30k

The credit union allows me to make a payment on the HeLoC with a credit card for a one time transaction fee of $14.95. I've done it several times with 0% interest cards so I know it works.

The HeLoC charges .017808% daily. The credit card only charges interest on overdue balances.

Can I make a $30k payment on the HeLoC from my Chase card at the beginning of the pay period and use the HeLoC to pay it off on the last day of every pay period? Other than the back and forth being annoying here is how I see the math breaking down:

\-$14.95 (Credit card charge fee)

\+ (approximately)$152.49 per month saved in interest

\+ 30,000 reward points monthly

This month though I was hit with a 16 point reduction due to purchases I made on my Amazon store card on the 4th (I guess I should have waited that one day). I paid off the credit on the 6th as well, but both Equifax and TransUnion hit me with this 16 point reduction and stated that it was due to this recent purchase from Amazon.  I checked all of my purchase and payment histories and can’t for the life of me figure out why my credit was hit with this much.  This is the most I’ve ever been hit with too, which was pretty jarring honestly. I always pay off my credit as soon as the payments go through. I was completely paid off of that card by the 25th, which I thought was the pay cycle. Can anyone explain to me what the pay cycles are for these cards? From everything I’ve read it should end on the 25th so why would my purchases on the 4th have counted towards this month’s credit score?  Do the cycles differ by card?

However, we have an great opportunity in the near future to purchase a house for less than market value at around $650K in San Diego, CA. We currently make about $189K with bonuses, no kids, $7K loan on car #1, $9K loan on car #2 (both to be paid off within 2 years), and enough for a 20% down payment ($130K) with emergency savings left over. Essentially our mortgage would be $520K after the down payment. Based on Zillow we're looking at roughly a $2,400 mortgage (P&amp;I) + $700 for taxes and home insurance. Utilities estimated around $350.

t3_bz21ms,Considering buying a home. Insane?,"Some background:

Early 30's. In marketing. Live in the south, so COL is reasonable. In the past have made good money ($90k+), but currently working as a contractor working part-time, making about $50k/yr. But as a contractor, my taxes are high so only really taking home about $3k/mo, and our health insurance is $500/mo on top of that. Add in car insurance, food, etc, and my $3k/mo is problematic. 

Wife is going back to school and is currently unemployed. I have about $50k in savings/investment accounts. Wife will graduate in 2 years in a medical field, expect her to make $60k+ upon graduation.  It's a really high-demand field, so that part is fairly rock solid. 

I'm in a bit of an odd situation. Money is clearly a bit tight at the moment, but I am fairly confident I can pretty easily get a job making $65k+. And, it's all really just a ""survive for 2 years and then we'll have a much higher combined income"" situation. 

Now, here's the thing. We have to move to her new school, which is an area with high rent (relative to my region). A 1br apartment goes for about $1,300/mo. Again, I think I can quickly get a job that would make this affordable, but I don't want to count on it. I only have a guaranteed take-home of $3k/mk for now, which would be a stretch to survive on with $1.3k rent. 

But I've been looking, and there are nice townhouses going for about $170k in the area. I have good credit. I could put down $30k or so and probably get a mortgage for about $700/mo, making this all a lot easier. But, here are my concerns:

1) Really never had a desire to buy at the moment. I'd much prefer to be a renter with lower risk for the time being. 

2) Only know we will be living in the area for 2 years while my wife finished school. Then who knows.
 
3) would have to put a big chunk of my savings down as a down payment. 

These 3 things make me think it's silly, but I can't get the idea out of my head that I could be buying a townhome for $700/mo vs renting a tiny apartment for $1,300/mo. Even if we leave in 2 years, I could rent it out or sell it. But I know the general rule is ""don't buy unless you plan on living somewhere for 5 years or more.""

Any insight here at all? Everything is telling me that buying is a bad idea, but the numbers are really compelling. Really appreciate your help on this.

I know the key to good responses is having a lot of information in my post, so I will do my best, because this is important to me and my family.

My grandparents are in their mid 90’s living in Florida. My grandma has serve dementia and my grandpa has just fallen and had to have major surgery on a broken hip replacement/leg last week. They said that there was a really good chance that he wasn’t going to survive the operation, and also said that he will most likely need to be put into hospice after some type of rehab/healing. He ended up making it through and is now in the process of making a transition to either rehab/a VA hospital.

My family is distraught and unsure of how to handle the financial situation going on, and also have no type of legal knowledge in regards to estates/wills. My grandpa has a net worth of $750k - 1M, but only about $140k cash that he just pulled out of the stock market sometime after the surgery. He has insurance so his medical bills should not be anything astronomical, but they are only covering 100 days in this rehab facility or hospice. 

My uncle mentioned that he has seen a lawyer to get his will and trust set up around 3 - 4 years ago. My Aunt has power of attorney, but is overwhelmed and having a hard time even understanding his financial situation and could possibly be missing things, or just flat out making wrong decisions. 

So this is where my questions start.

1. My grandparents will need somewhere to go other than my aunts, because she is driven insane by my grandma with dementia. What are the options? Could we somehow leverage the VA hospital/ another program? or is hospice/live in caretaker a better rout all together.

2. It’s to my understanding that he set up his will/trust to pay out after he died peacefully later on down the line in his sleep and didn’t expect anything like this to happen. What is the smart thing to do with his finances this late in the game? Is getting a FA advisor sketchy at this point? Is putting any cash he has sitting in a bank, into a house a bad idea? Can that be gone after if something happens/money becomes an issue for them? 

I’m trying to get just get any information that I can pass on to them. So if you’ve read this far and take the time to comment, I truly appreciate it. Please let me know if I’m missing anything at all.",1

I am trying to make some big changes in my life, and am a little overwhelmed with what steps I need to take moving forward with my Debt. I did read the FAQ, and the approach seems to be in general, pay interest rates above 4% as soon as possible. Right now I have $23,000 available to me. I am trying to decide what should be refinanced from my loans, if I should pay my highest interest loan now or refinance, and how much money I should invest. I have, and always will match my 401K because my employer matches. To me, it makes sense to refinance some of my loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29, and have about $3,500 invested. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have received an interest rate offer to pay the following, I would aim to refinance the loans below that are above this rate. Except for the 12% interest, which I am going to pay off in full I believe. I am a little nervous about doing Float rate as I do not want to get stuck with an even higher interest rate. The quote below was off of $57k.

10 Year Fixed--$625.68---5.75%

10 Year Float--$598.19---4.77%

I currently make a little over $80,000. I plan on improving my budget, eating out less and all that. I am also currently job searching, and might have to take a small cut in base salary to be aligned with my field, which I have a masters in, so I hope in the long run this decision pays dividends. My bonus every year is low, as is my raise (basically inflation increase), so I am hoping my next opportunity has a bit more growth.

This is my most recent bill on the income based repay plan: 

I have $2k in interest, also wondering if I should pay that off, or because I am thinking about refinancing it does not matter right now. I am pretty disappointed in how much of my payment goes towards interest right now.

t3_bz75sm,Is a HELOC a decent option for me?,"I am a new homeowner, never had a HELOC or even knew what one was prior to buying my first home last November. 

I bought my first home in november 2018 for $235K and put down $50k for a mortgage of $185K. 

Soon after moving in we had some somewhat unexpected costs related to the house pop up totaling $20K. While I do have the money saved to pay it outright, I would prefer to keep that money in the bank and was offered 18 months 0% so I took it. An 18 month 20K loan for free, why not. 

We also recently had our first child and all the expenses that come with that. I was hoping to be able to pay off the loan over the 18 months without tapping into savings to hard but it is proving to not turn out that way. There is 15K remaining and close to $1500/mo in payments. Currently I am pulling about 1K/mo from savings to make these payments. Its not a huge deal, because I originally was just going to pay the whole thing from savings, but its not ideal. 

Financial situation. 

$10K in mutual funds/a few stocks I like

$30K in high yield savings 

$12k between my wife and I's IRAs

$6K in checking


No other debts. 

I would like to pay this remaining 15K off over a longer period of time and without having to keep pulling from savings. I also kind of wish i hadnt put as much down on my house as I did. Interest rates are low and Id rather have gone with 25K down (about 10%) but was new at homebuying and honestly thought I had to put at least 20% down. 

My local credit union will give me a 15 year HELOC @ 3.25% for 12 months and then variable rate after that which is just the prime rate. It seems to me if I do this it would essentially be like I just put 15K less down on my house and I would just have a slightly higher mortgage payment if I consider them together which I would have preferred anyway. This way i can stop pulling from savings and have a MUCH more manageable payment at a good rate and go back to contributing to savings every month instead of drawing from it. 

Does this seem like a solid plan? Anything I should know? Any reason I shouldn't do this? Really just anyone's opinions at all are appreciated.",1
t3_bz73cy,Vanguard Solo 401k Fees,"Hello,

I was wondering about Vanguard Solo 401k fees or I guess how Vanguard does fees in general. I know the Solo 401k charges $20 for each fund you have in the account before you hit 50k in your portfolio. First question is is the $20 fee charged after a full year of opening the account, when do they choose to charge the fee? Second question is if you do hit 50k will it include other accounts too like a Roth IRA. And last question is what happens if your investments hit 50k but then market goes down and drops to under 50k, will you get the fee again?

I am working for a company that has 100% company paid for benefits, and a salary of $63,000. I love the company I work for and know that within 5 years i'll be making around 100k if I stay on the career path I am working towards.

 Throughout college I was self supported by working and using refunds from my financial aid. I exited college with **$29,680** **in student loan debt**. Which I know isn't bad for 5 years of college and only working part-time. The issue is, I had to take a financial hit in a variety of areas that left me in collections: After finally reviewing my credit report, after years of hiding it under the rug until I graduated, I made a spreadsheet of the collectors and amounts. I discovered I have a total of **$2,680 in collection debt.** Ranging from old credit cards I was charged off for, medical/emergency room bills, to cable companies from not paying the last 2 month of services. All of this stemming from negligence and only working part-time because of the grind engineering classes required. I also have a current credit card, and my only open line of credit, that is a $3,000 limit and almost maxed out. 

Now that I am making a salary, I have calculated how much my checks will be after taxes roughly every 2 weeks, and also calculated what my monthly expenses are. 

With a take home monthly income of 3600 a month and monthly expenses ranging at about $1,180 (including rent) I am trying to figure out the best way to handle my debt. I have read on multiple threads about specific ways to handle collections which has me worried because a big goal for me is to get my credit out of the low 500s.

My goal is to save up and get a new car within a year but obviously isn't feasible given my credit and debt situation. I also am very confused on how to handle the debt collections.

t3_bz4dlx,"Question about the PF prime directive and how it applies to Roth IRAs, Thrift Savings Plan, and Ultra Low Cost (Or No Cost) Mutual Funds","I'm currently a 28 year old pilot in the Air Force making ~$100k/year and my wife is an aviation safety consultant making ~$30-35k/year (sometimes $4k+/month, sometimes zero -- e.g. govt shutdown).  Our taxes are relatively low due to tax exempt allowances and combat zone tax exclusions, so we've been contributing to Roths since we expect our income to go up substantially in the future and have relatively low taxes now.

My retirement strategy for the past few years has been to max out my Roth Thrift Savings Plan ($19k/year, 0.04% ER) account taking advantage of the 5% matching from the military's new retirement system.  I have a Roth IRA with Vanguard I don't currently contribute to, but I maintain a balanced 3 fund profile there from previous contributions.  Recently, all of my shares that weren't admiral shares were automatically converted and the expense ratios went down accordingly. The rest of my savings has been towards expanding my emergency fund for the future, potential house down payment, and replacing both of our aging cars with newer used cars.

My wife maxes a Roth IRA with Fidelity taking advantage of their zero &amp; low cost funds using a 3 fund profile and saves towards our house and increasing our emergency fund as well.

My questions are:

1) With the ""race to the bottom"" on index fund ERs, should I now be prioritizing my IRA over my TSP (assuming I always max out matching) or leave things the way they are?  The prime directive sort of says maybe you could prioritize TSP over IRA sometimes.  Roth IRAs seem to have more flexibility and are less painful to withdraw from when you hit retirement compared to a Roth TSP, but I have limited understanding on this.  It seems like the best reason to use TSP historically was the ridiculously low ERs, but they've slowly crept up and met/almost met/exceeded publicly available mutual funds.

2) Is there a more effective way for my wife to invest given our situation and that she's self employed?

However, I recently moved to a more suburban area just outside the city (5-10 minute drive) and noticed the bus stops heading downtown (where I work just about daily) are 20 mins on foot from my house.

t3_bz6i0y,Question Regarding Plans for Retirement,"Me (M/45) and my wife (F/44) are childless and focusing on early retirement. We’ve saved $1.2M across her 401k ($300,000), combined Vanguard IRAs ($300,000) and Roth IRAs ($200,000). We put away $2,600/mo by maxing both Roths and her 401k. We also got a $400k inheritance (factored In to the $1.2M) that adds to our investment holdings.

Based on the Dave Ramsey retirement calculator, using the 7% annual return that accounts for inflation, we’re on track for $4.8 million at age 62. Using a 4% draw down, that would account for an annual income of $192,000 or $16,000 month in current dollars.

A couple questions:

1.	I’m wondering how much we are likely to have to pay in taxes on that $16,000/mo?
2.	Given that we are likely to own our home outright at age 62, and may have additional inheritance of $1M+ by then, I’m wondering how to factor what other expenses we are likely to incur. Would it be crazy to think that we could do four trips of $10k each per year and still have sufficient cushion?

t3_bz690m,Employer 401k (Voya) fund selection,"Hi all! I am beginning to seriously think about my finances as I feel I haven't been paying attention to them enough in the past. I have read the wiki entry about fund selection but am having a hard time bridging the gap between the suggested guidelines and what I have available in my employer sponsored 401k plan through Voya. 

**Some info about me:** 25 years old with a salary of ~50k with a 10k car loan, 23k in my 401k at 6% contribution (19k in a Fidelity plan, 4k in Voya), and 55k saved in a regular bank account. I am moving later in the year and expect a raise around this time and will also be job searching to see if I can find something just better overall for me. I also plan on doing something with the money in my old 401k (rolling it to an IRA or something).

t3_bz690l,"I'm using my savings card as a debit card, is this alright?","First of all, I am from Brazil, and am not familiar at all with the finance related terms in english, please ask me for details if I wrote anything that doesn't seem right.

Well, I am not really someone that knows much about finances, but I don't really spend more money than I need, and I have been using my savings card as a debit card, for daily needs, such as food on the university cafe while all day out of home, but nothing that takes a huge load of money from there, usually, and that while keeping a nice income every month.

I thought all was fine and well like this, with my money yielding profit, but my aunt told me I should make a checking account, because the savings account won't profit me properly if I keep on using the money in there.

The thing is, I am receiving some profit on my account, some quite inconsistent profit that I gain everyday, but that sums to a decent profit-like amount at the end of the month (I check that on my bank's app, and well, while I can't say for sure, I always assumed this random money I gain everyday as 'CRED JUROS', as written in my language, was, well, the profit, but I may be gravely mistaken). Is there really a problem with using my savings money frequently, even if it is a reasonable amount compared to the income?

If I am not mistaken about the 'CRED JUROS' being the profit I am supposed to receive, I'd say keeping all my money on the savings account would be more profitable than having my account static while depositing half the amount I am depositing right now so I can use the other half on a checking card, since by depositing the full amount of money I currently am depositing would have me profit more than depositing half of it, while I haven't spent it, since it is a daily thing.

So, yeah, is it alright for me to use it as a debit card, or is it better to get a checking card as my aunt suggests?",1

Just looked at my online banking, and over the course of four days, last month, multiple purchases of 6-8000 at a time have been made from my bank account, totalling just over £70,000

Barclays Bank were pretty ok about it, they said it’s likely a cloned card - because they considered the amount of be quite large, they wouldn’t be able to refund the money immediately and would have to investigate, but that I shouldn’t worry. 

Trouble is, after reading a ton about Barclays refusing to refund money, I’m now worried they’re Going to conclude the investigation and tell me I’m at fault.  

I have no knowledge of the transactions, and they were (luckily) made on days I can remember my exact movements.

t3_bymgt0,Why cancelling Amazon Prime was my best financial decision this year,"You can buy everything on Amazon. I currently live in the middle of nowhere, and love the convenience of buying things that would normally require a 5 hour drive to civilization. However, my spending was starting to look like Michael Scott's- the ""stuff that nobody, ever, ever needs"" category was getting up there (smart scales, colorful pens, resistance bands). In March, my annual Prime subscription was up and after a less-than-stellar customer service experience, I cancelled.

I still get free shipping- all items marked as Prime eligible ship free if you have $25 dollars in your cart. This has helped curb the impulse buys of dumb crap. Letting things sit in my cart for a week has forced me to be more conscious of what I'm buying and now I think through those useless things I don't really need.

This probably isn't the best decision for everyone. My area doesn't have a Whole Foods, or Prime Same-Day. Groceries are cheap where I live, so I got no use out of Prime Pantry. I have other streaming services for video and music. Ultimately, I wish I had cancelled sooner.",1

t3_bz601j,Need Help Budgeting After Multiple Failed Attempts,"Hi there. Quick background about me and as to why I'm making this post. The past 3 summers , I've made around 5-6000 each year and every time, within half a year I've wasted it all. I'm very lucky to have had those opportunities in high school and my freshman year, but I want to manage my money much better this year as I really felt the consequences of having spent all my money too fast this year. I wanted to provide the details and have you guys help me and critique me if that's alright.

&amp;#x200B;

So, before taxes, I will be making around $13,000 this summer. I live in NYC, and I know my company takes off taxes for me for thinks like Social, Medicare, etc. so that I don't have to, but I'm not sure what I'll end up with after taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I assume it's around 40% so I'll be left with $8000. I borrowed 300 from both my mom and sister so that leaves me at 7400. My little brother did not lock down a job and he's going into college as well so I want to leave him with around $500 leaving me at 6900. I need to leave at least 1500 in both my checking and saving I believe so as to not be docked by fees, and making that money untouchable, leaving me with 3900. This is where it gets tricky for me. Having planned this far is already a huge step for me and I really want to hold myself to that untouchable 3000. But I'm also a big spender. I want to give myself 1500ish for miscellaneous, school stuff, and fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

The BIG question is, is 1400 enough to put into savings/investments, and if so, where the heck do I put it because my parents don't know about any of that and neither do I.

t3_bz5zms,Introductory 0% APR Credit Cards,"Greetings smart people,

I have a picture in my head of how I could really benefit from a 0% APR credit card and I wanted to make sure that I’m not missing anything before I apply.

I’ll start off by briefly explaining my situation. I graduated 2.5 years ago and have been working as an engineer ever since. I have no real debt (I’m very lucky), and no dependents so I have been able to save a substantial portion of my income.  I will be returning to school for a master’s program this fall, and I am planning on not working at all during my first semester.

I have been looking at 0% Introductory APR credit cards because I’m hoping that I could rely on one for basically all of my daily purchases while I have no income. Almost all of my money is invested, and I would prefer not to cash out any of my holdings while I’m in school. If I can simply pay the minimum payment on the card every month while accumulating no interest or late fees, then I can pay off the debt next summer (the card I’m looking at has 0% APR for 15 months). By next summer I will (hopefully) have a paid internship that I can use to pay off all of the debt.

Can anyone see any flaws in this line of thinking? Like I said, I want to keep as much of my savings invested as I can and this will allow me to do that. Are there any permanent credit score issues that could come from only paying the minimum monthly payment every month?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1

t3_bz5udn,Dealing with Verizon,"Last summer I had an account with Verizon go into collections.

However, it first went into Verizon's internal collections department.

Their collections department never sent any sort of paperwork or called me claiming I owed them money. The last correspondence I received from Verizon was a bill. 

At the time, I did not have the money to pay the account.

Now the account is with an outside collection agency called IC System. However IC System is not listed on my credit, Verizon is.

While the account was with Verizon, they added a nearly $100 ""Collection fee"".

IC System is not the ones who added this charge.

After speaking with Verizon's executive office, they blamed IC System for adding this fee, and after I engaged in a 3-way call with Verizon and IC System, Verizon suddenly walked back what they said and claimed ""well even if we did add it, we won't remove it"".

I wish to settle this debt and get it behind me, but I'm not paying this fee if Verizon will not remove it. In fact I talk to my state's AG and they said it's not even allowable for them to add a fee.

Verizon has been sued many times in the past and they are pretty much stonewalling me trying to get this fixed. 

They are 

The balance on my credit report does not reflect this charge and is not accurate as required under the FDCPA.

Verizon has now flagged my account to automatically transfer me to the outside collection agency and won't help me, they said ""we are not removing any charges and this matter is now closed"" and hung up.

The outside collection agency is not listed on my credit report, Verizon is, therefore the onus is on them to fix this.

For clarification I live in the US and have never visited the UAE and have not once interacted with this bank.

Once more I emailed multiple people at the bank to take me off their lists and that I am not the person they are trying to get payment from. No response.

t3_bz5qmj,Buy a car for in-laws?,"So I’ll just go right into the facts and save the emotion/opinions for the end.

My in-laws are terrible with money. Multiple bankruptcies. Overspending. Missed payments. Bad Credit. You know the drill.

They have a 2013/14 Buick Enclave that is almost paid off, but it needs at least a 3k repair to fix the A/C (Texas heat). They don’t have the money. In fact they already paid over a $1000 trying to fix the problem.

I don’t want to give them money because I’m not sure it will even fix the problem or the car won’t have another big issue in the near term and now I’ve set a precedent for just fixing their problems. I also do not think a loan is reasonable/I’d ever actually get my money back, but maybe this is the least bad option?

It was suggested they trade it in and I co-sign the note so they get approved but I don’t like that idea because then my credit is damaged if they miss a payment.

I’m considering buying their car from them and trading it in and “leasing” them a new car. I figure at least this way I am in control of the Asset and the payments (if I finance it).

So why would I do this? 
Well they watch our son a lot since I travel and my wife and I both work. I feel obligated to help because they help us all the time and I am able financially to do so. 
I also do not want them driving around in an unsafe vehicle with my kid.

The company folded and I went back to school. I recently read that freelancers have to pay 15% of their income and file every quarter, but the quarter has already passed. I was planning on filing it for April 2020, but there would be a 5% penalty for each month of not filing.

What is the best course of action? Since I didn't save that money (I foolishly thought that I could continue at the company and save money later), the earliest I'll receive money would be in August with FAFSA. I have around $300 left, but I'll have to pay far more money to the IRS than that.

We both contribute around the max to our respective 401ks.  (around 18k, I’ll admit I don’t try to max it down to the dollar but just be in the area without going over)
We both have Life Insurance, health insurance through work, and additional life insurance (term) outside of that. 
We have mutual fund investments through Northwestern Mutual (I’m not happy with this and looking to change, but that isn’t what the post is about, except I don’t want to put any more toward this).  We contribute about $1600/month to these. 
 
Even with all this though, I find that our budget from 5 years ago largely works for all of our expenses and that means with various raises and the like since then, we have just been gathering the excess into a savings account.  Then a family member passed and left me roughly 45k, and now I feel an urgent need to get this money working.  It’s now much more than I’d want for an emergency fund.
 
I’m just not sure what to do with it.  I thought the easy solution was to get going on a Traditional IRA with Vanguard, so I did that. But that’s capped at 6k a year and we can likely contribute more than that, not to mention the extra I currently have I’d like to put to work sooner.
 
Is the answer simple and I’m just making it more complex than it needs to be?  Should I just put more money into mutual funds and call it a day?  Or is there some other thing I should be doing?  I **think** my wife could also open an IRA and contribute 6k a year, but I’m not really sure.  Should I be doing that before or after more mutual funds if I can? One thing I am certain of is that if the answer is mutual funds, I need to do something other than what I’m currently doing and put it in no load funds (with Vanguard?) rather than managed funds with Northwestern Mutual. Are more mutual funds just the easy button to press from now on?
 
And one final question is if I do end up with an IRA between my wife and myself, with all the other investments, should I backdoor these over to Roth IRAs?  Is there ever a reason *not* to do this?",1

t3_bz5klv,Best options for a car refinance?,"I bought a car last year as my first major purchase, and even though I maintain a 700-750 credit score I didn't have any major loan history. As a result I was given an 8% interest rate on the car for an 84 month finance. The dealership recommended that I make payments for around a year and then seek refinance. Skip ahead to one year later with no missed payments and every lender I speak with say I should easily qualify for 3% interest rates given quick checks of my credit but after a full credit report I keep getting denied with the issue being unapid medical bills on my report from a couple years ago that are tied up in an insurance dispute.

&amp;#x200B;

At the current interest rate the value of the car is going to quickly go under what is owed and I can't really afford to make more than the regular monthly payments. I was hoping to get the lower interest rate in order to make the payments better and pay off the car faster. So what are my options to help in getting the car refinanced, are there some lenders more forgiving than others or perhaps going into a bank in person to explain my history would make a difference on loan acceptance?",1

His income (and spending) is much much greater than mine. He doesn't carry a balance, and doesn't miss payments. 

Credit Karma currently shows my credit utilization at under 5%, but the total balance is almost $700. Only about $40 of that is from my card, the rest is from his. My income is about $2000. 

I applied for a wells fargo retail card (Microcenter) in late May, and was declined. I'm trying to call Wells Fargo and get a reason, but its Wells Fargo. I want to get the new Chase Student CC, but am worried that I'll get declined for that too.

I'm pushing 40.

Currently, I net about $3,850/mo, have about 21k left of my own student loans — 4-6.5% interest that could be forgiven in 3-4 years, but will eat ~10% of my take-home — and I pay around 30% net to rent. It's a bigger city, but I might be able to get that down to 25% after this lease is up. I devote 10% toward utilities, and I keep things fairly tight in the eating out and entertainment department —10% altogether.

I anticipate ~&lt;5% toward child support and servicing the rest of the community debt she holds.

Right now I know I need a few years to get up to 3 mos. backup and to bank my car replacement too, ~$20k altogether, but I'm not sure how much to devote to those student loans in the meantime. They are low-interest and will likely be forgiven, tax-free, in the next few years. Public service workers be like ... 

I'd love to put money toward home equity instead of rent, but its definitely a seller's market here, and I am *nowhere* near a down payment for a house. My credit is pristine (820+) though, but that and a kick to my nuts would be a kick to my nuts with good credit.

Do I just hunker down with this plan for the next few years? Is there a way to leverage current interest rates and my credit to kickstart my savings plan? I want to have enough liquid for emergencies, especially when my car kicks it, but I want to start making up for lost time as quickly as possible.

t3_bz5bx0,I like the idea of Charle's Schwab's subscription advisors,"\*DISCLAIMER: I do not have a stake in Charles Schwab. This is an ""average joe"" expressing an impression on a new way to handle personal finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Since getting the email promoting Schwab's new program, I've been giving it a hard thought on how this could be beneficial. When I made my personal brokerage account, I did so with the explicit thought of minimizing the costs for my investing. Essentially taking out the middle man. I never thought about paying for the advisor per call because I didn't want to pay $25 per call.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know about it. Schwab will charge you $300 up front and $30 per month for *unlimited* one-on-one calls with Schwab financial advisors. Sounds like a lot when you consider that upcharge. So here's the math behind it:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\-------$300 upfront

\+ $30 \* 12 monthly

\----------------------------

\-------$660 annually

&amp;#x200B;

VS

&amp;#x200B;

$25 per call

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

This means that if you were to opt for the subscription, you would need to activate your unlimited subscription at least 27 times in a year to make this service worth the money, otherwise you'll be better off sticking with paying per call.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't earn enough money yet to consider paying this amount of money, so people like me that are just starting out ought to wait a while before going this route. After all, that $600 a year would more than cover your online stock trading fees. However, I will recommend it if you already have a lot of money tied up in your brokerage account and want to get a second opinion before you make a trade based on the latest craze in the news. I know I'll use it when I get to that point in my life where a single bad decision could lose you thousands of dollars in a week.",1

t3_bz5afr,Question about a Sallie Mae Tuition Answer Loan in Navient,"My student loans are currently being serviced by Navient. I’ve called them and they confirmed over the phone that all of my loans are in good standing (I’ve been overpaying them for months after I went through a rehabilitation program). I have also contacted the National Student Loan Database and had them confirm the same on the phone, including the loan details that I can verify on the Navient portal. Currently I have a consolidated subsidized loan at 6.875% interest rate with $20k remaining, and a consolidated unsubsidized loan also at 6.875% interest rate with around $28k remaining.

However, in my Navient portal, there is an additional loan, called “Steven’s Tuition Answer.” This is a Sallie Mae Tuition Answer loan that my father took out (not me). The original principal was $6,417 and now the current balance is over $17,327, as I’m assuming he never paid anything towards it and it’s been over ten years. I didn’t even know this loan existed until it showed up in my Navient portal.

I have called Navient numerous times to get more info about this loan but nobody has been able to help me, as they consider the loan a “charge-off,” which gets handled by a third party vendor. Since I didn’t take the loan out, it makes it even more challenging. I am looking for (written) confirmation that I am not responsible for this loan and that it will not impact my credit score (I do not see it on my Credit Karma account). How should I proceed to get assurances this loan that he took out won’t impact my credit score or that I will not be liable to pay it back?

I have several cards with these offers as I have never done a balance transfer before.

Now I have the means to pay it off, but I would like to transfer the balance so that I can use that cash for other things.  If I transfer the balance to one of these 0% cards, will my credit be affected if I do not make monthly payments for a while?  I would like to use the $8500 that I would use to pay off the card as a mini loan essentially to do some crypto trading.

t3_bz2gwf,Collection Agency Contacting My Father for Grandmother's (Deceased) Nursing Home Bills,"Hey Guys,

I have a question regarding the liability of my father to pay my grandmother's nursing home bills. About 1.5 years ago my grandmother with dementia ended up in the hospital and was subsequently discharged to a nursing home where she lived for about a year and subsequently passed away. She was initially insured under medicare/medicaid but lost her coverage because while she was in the hospital her bank account grew too large from her social security benefits and she was automatically removed from her insurance plan as she had too many assets in the bank. This happened while my father was attempting to obtain guardianship and this process took several months. Essentially there was a period of time where he was unable to access these funds in order to spend them on her care. After he obtained guardianship and spent the money, he reapplied for medicaid/medicare and her nursing home care was covered. This left a period of about 3-4 months in the middle where her care was not covered and the nursing home has been contacting him with bills for $8,000 directed at him for her care. The latest is that he has received a letter from a collection agency with this sum. He resides in NJ and the nursing home is in NJ. Is he responsible for paying these bills? Obviously if it's going to collection then it could ruin his credit which is obviously not ideal. Would an elder law attorney be helpful in this case or is there a different professional that we should contact that is more suited for answering questions about this problem?

t3_bz2gij,Structured Settlement Annuity. Frozen?,"To keep this brief, i'm looking for some advice if there is anything I can do. 

When I was very young my mother passed away, it was a wrongful death and we received a settlement. 

This was a structured settlement annuity according to the paper work I have. Since this happened when I was so young I never thought to understand but I am now getting close to the age when i'm able to receive my lump sum and something is very troubling to me. 

How the settlement was set up was that when I get to a certain age I receive one lump sum of money. This money is tax free but the money is just sitting in an account frozen. From what I gather is that in many cases structured settlements are supposed to gain interest over time but in my case I do not, I DON'T GET WHY. Over almost 30 years this amount would have likely doubled or even tripled. 

Has anybody heard of a structured settlement being frozen and not gaining any interest? From what I have gathered the insurer paid into the annuity, so is the financial institution holding the money gaining all that interest? I talked to the institution and they said it is not gaining any interest and that I will receive the one lump sum on this date. 

Is there anything I can do to get this money faster so that it is still not sitting there so I can at least invest it and grow it? Or are structured settlements iron clad. My dad is who set this account up many years ago, he also passed over 10 years ago as well so I have no details on how or why it was set up this way. His thinking was that if I wait until i'm at a certain age that I wouldn't spend it all and would already have my life set up so that by the time I get it, I don't need it and can just invest it. Which I understand that thought but having that money just sit there frozen just kills me knowing how much return we could have got. 

Does anybody know anything about structured settlements? Does anybody know if there is anything I can do? Should I be gaining interest or is that something that is unique to each case and the terms of the contract?",1

t3_bz52tg,How do HSA rollovers work?,"For some background, I am a healthy 25 year old with a HDHP and HSA through HSA bank. I currently have about $600 in my account. I am interested in investing this money in an index fund and not touching it until I retire (assuming I stay healthy). My father has done this and has over 100k sitting in his HSA. He has saved receipts for his healthcare expenses for the past 10 years that he will use to reimburse himself tax free during retirement. Seeing as I'm in my mid 20s, I think this has awesome growth potential if I stay healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that HSA bank requires $1000 to begin investing. Additionally, you need to maintain a cash account balance of $5000 to avoid paying a $5/month fee. This is frustrating because I am probably 2 years away from hitting 5k in my account. My employer pays whatever fees are required to provide employees with HSA bank, but they do not contribute to my HSA or cover any investment fees. I am contributing $135 per paycheck (pre-tax), directly to my HSA bank account

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are:

1) Can I rollover my funds to another HSA provider (such as Fidelity), and begin no-fee, first dollar investing? Is this allowed? My employer would continue to have my pre-tax money sent to HSA bank.

2) If yes, would I then have to continually rollover funds from HSA Bank to Fidelity? I would probably do this every 1k or so

3) Is this going to be a total pain in the ass come tax season?

t3_bz4x75,401k Contributions:Roth vs Trad vs Both,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice on how to make my 401k contributions. My Company allows me to split 401k contributions into both traditional and Roth if I want to.

About me:

* Mid 20's, work in IT
* I'm currently in the 22% federal tax bracket
   * I'm bordering the 24% tax bracket which I will very likely hit within a year's time
   * My income will definitely be higher in the future
* State income tax is 6%
   * I'm staying in this state for the foreseeable future

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand about Roth vs Trad 401k:

**With a Roth 401k**

* Contributions are taxed
* Earnings are not taxed while I keep working
* When I retire and withdraw my funds (contributions + earnings), those are **not taxed at all**

&amp;#x200B;

**With a Traditional 401k**

* Contributions are not taxed
* Earnings are not taxed while I keep working
* When I retire and withdraw my funds (contributions + earnings), those **are** **taxed** according to my income

t3_bz4wri,I will be out of work for the next year.. should I convert my existing traditional 401(k) to Roth?,"My husband and I will be traveling for the next year or so, and we won't have any income during that time.  Come tax season next year, we'll have only the paychecks we've thus far received to claim.  Between the both of us, that's about $51k, gross.  We file jointly.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 401(k) with my previous employer that is mostly Roth.  However, there's a fair chunk that came from pre-tax contributions, before Roth was offered.  That amounts to about $27k.  I'm considering rolling over my 401(k) anyway, just to consolidate my investments, and I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to convert the non-Roth portion while our income bracket is much lower.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a big proponent for Roth, so I don't really need convincing on whether or not Roth is a good choice (I'm also young - early 30s); I'm more looking for thoughts on if this is a good time or if it's worth it for that amount.  I understand I would owe the taxes now if I move forward, and I also wouldn't mind some links if anyone has a good calculator on figuring out what that amount might be (my searching only seems to find ""is Roth right for you""-type calculators).  I wouldn't dream of paying the taxes out of the balance; I would take that out of separate savings funds.

&amp;#x200B;

As we'll be traveling for a year, I was thinking I could also convert half this year and the other half next year to better spread the expense.  I'm not certain when we'll be back, though, or if/when I'll have a job again, so I can less accurately calculate the tax impact for next year.

t3_bz4v6s,Tax Implications of M1 Finance?,"Hello, I got drawn to the fact that M1 Finance uses a ""pie"" model and also fractional shares. It also has automatic investment, which simplifies things in life.  I have a question or two about potential tax implications years down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently made a pie of 25 different stocks, so pretty much my ""pie"" is 25 different securities. These are all dividend stocks from major companies on the Stock Market. I initially will put $1000 into my M1 account, but I also want to setup an automatic investment of $100 a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, comes the hard part with the taxes. Essentially, once per week M1 Finance will make 25 trades on my behalf buying a fraction of each of those shares by evenly splitting up the $100. This adds up to 1,300 trades per year(52 weeks x 25 different trades per week = 1,300). Not to mention any dividend payments these stocks will pay me.  This can be a lot of accounting at the end of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a bad strategy? From what I understand EVERY TIME you buy or sell any security, you create a taxable event. This can become a problem one year from now when I have to do my taxes. Anybody have experience with M1 Finance, especially the taxes portion of it? Anybody did their taxes with Turbotax and import the 1099 from M1 onto there? I know M1 Finance provides you with all the 1099 forms you need at the end of the year. Will all pertinent info be in there regarding 1,300 trades?

Called again and were told this could have been for damages at need of lease, at point if return for the inspection the guy said everything was fine. 

Called back and said it was because we had returned the car early.

t3_bz4fsp,Thinking about trading in my car for an equivalent SUV. Rational or irrational decision?,"I have a 2016 Toyota Corolla with 56000 miles. My parents gave me a loan when I bought it, so I have been paying them monthly for the car. I still owe about $5000 on the car with 2 years left on my payment plan to my parents. So in the eyes of whoever I trade it in to, it is completely paid off.  


I have been looking into trading it in for a used/CPO 2016-2018 SUV with 40000 miles or less due to the fact that occasionally I need to drive around large items (Pelican, SKB cases, large boxes, etc) for work. I can usually get those items to fit in my car, but it is very tight, takes up all of the trunk, rear seats, and passenger seat, and the \[larger items\]([https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/transport-case/protector/1690](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/transport-case/protector/1690)) barely fit through the rear doors, making it difficult to get the items in and out by myself without scratching the interior of my car's rear doors. I usually drive these larger items for about 5-6 round trips a year(usually a 3-5 hour drive each way) and drive a total of 20000 miles a year for work purposes. So I don't need an SUV constantly, but when I do have to squeeze my car full of stuff, it really sucks. On the personal side, it would also be nice to have a larger car for my GF and me to have for beach/road trips that we do each summer as well as planning ahead a few years to have a larger car for children. My biggest worries are that I really like my car now and have maintained it really well. Used/CPO SUV's with lowish mileage are also likely to have been maintained well, but I don't want to end up with a problematic car.

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting a small raise from my company that would cover the cost of the car on a monthly basis plus some, but since the raise is not specifically for the car, I could also just use that money and save that money for future needs. Even without the raise I can afford the new car without it making too much of a dent in my budget, but I don't want to unnecessarily spend $1500-$2000 extra a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in the minds of r/personalfinance, would going through with this be rational or irrational?

t3_bzaqbl,"(US, 23) $35,000 in credit card debt and $10,000 in student loans. How bad is my situation?","Hi everyone,

I am in a tough financial situation. I am graduating with my Bachelor's in Business Administration at the end of August from a prestigious university that is well known for its business program, and as the title shows, I am in a lot and a lot of debt.

Right now my credit card debt is at $28,000 and will be $35,000+ at the end of August once tuition and other expenses are factored in and taken care of. My subsidized student loans are sitting at $10,000. At least on the bright side, I will be graduating, yay!

Before anyone asks me why I am in such a shitty position, it was very hard to put myself through community college and then university after being disowned and growing up in the system! I had to keep my poverty background a secret and compensate for not having parents or a high status life by fronting the costs for many things myself through debt (rent, clothing, food, maintenance and upkeep). Which, if you think about it, is not really that much money. That's about $700-1500 average living expenses per MONTH. That is ALL I need to not only survive but be HAPPY. I cannot FIND a steady income source that provides this.

Thankfully, taking on insanely risky debt at such an early, formative period of my adulthood allowed me many of the blessings I have today, which is 

1. a body that is alive and functioning, mostly 

2. a brain that has not succumbed to mental illness, and functions, mostly and 

3. a formal, American, university education to my name.

So my total debt is what is left over for 6 years of living expenses, after what I have been able to pay and continue paying from sporadic work and scholarships. I started out with nothing to my name, so here is where I am at. I have probably paid about $7000 in interest over those 6 years alone. I also had a very difficult time between years 3-6 as I became homeless, was temporarily disabled due to an injury, got fired and could not do basic things such as cook and prepare food, or clean...so yes, you are very correct that I delivered all my food and ate take out until I could use my limbs to produce whatever income I could afterwards so I can then purchase and prepare my own food.

Basically, life sucks. Paying to live sucks too. Not being able to afford living because you have to study before you can earn money also sucks. I don't need to be judged on that. I just need a plan to get out of this, and good news, I am graduating, yay! Which means all I need is a full-time job after I am no longer forced to go to classes for a piece of paper. I can just go to work 9-5 instead, which is cool. I can even work after 5PM as well to whenever, which is also cool. I can do all that. I actually have been wanting to do all that but I haven't been able to because I need to graduate first. And have work experience. I don't have both though, so graduating will have to do until I can have both.

And stat for my job hunt for the past 3 years:

1000+ job applications and counting!
25+ first round interviews
15+ final round interviews
2 interviews where I was the shortlist candidate
0 offers :)

I have already checked out every business/finance/startup/corporate website, forum, help whatever bullshit there is. None of their advice applies to me. It is for people who come from privilege. Of my comparable peers, I am at the absolute bottom of hireability. My admission into my program was a complete anomaly and I am shocked I have not dropped out yet. I am being completely frank and honest, not self-defeating or negative. People like me should NOT enter rigorous or prestigious programs if they have no connections or do not come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. I only exist to make other candidates and students look better for being higher on the social hierarchy, and to raise applicant numbers for everything so that only the select few can be chosen. It is how the world works. 

Out of all the suggestions people have given me, it seems that my problem is, I am too proud and confident in my abilities and background than my work history leads on, and I am over reliant on the education I do have. I have not tried lying yet, since I have no reason to and there is nothing in any of my job applications I should even be ashamed of to conceal or misrepresent. It is just disheartening to stare down an empty future ahead with no hope for a job while the interest fees pile up, and I am running out of time. Thank you.",1

t3_bz449e,Should I be worry about my savings being seized?,"I'm disabled, and my employment history has been checkered most of my adult life. A few years ago I had a major health crisis and was hospitalized for about a month in addition to an ambulance ride and a few shorter, related hospitalizations of a 2-4 days a piece. Needless to say, I wracked up a lot of medical debt which I have not been able to pay.

About a year ago, I managed to find employment that I am able to do given my health problems, but it's not much. I clear about $500 a month or so. I realize that is nothing to most people, but it's nice to have for me. In a typical month I am able to save about $200, and over the last few months I've saved up over $1000. Again, it's not much to most people here I'm sure, but it's more than I've ever had in savings before.

t3_bz40ll,What should I do with +$1600 Graduation presents,"I just graduated high school and I have received over $1600 from friends and family. Prior to this I had only $1100 in the bank so this is a chunk of change for me.

I have no idea what to do with this money. I'm not moving out anytime soon. I am going to community college in the fall but that is already paid for.

I work about 40 hours a week making $10.50 (only since I graduated, before I worked 16-20 a week at $9). I drive a 1996 Subaru Legacy but I'd like to get a different vehicle eventually. This car is well worn (203,000 miles) and has required maintenance from time to time.

I was thinking about opening a new savings account with a better interest rate? The credit union I bank at offers a ""five for five"" savings account where you get 5% APR on the first $500. I already have $500 in savings and the return once you're above that threshold is very low. I think I have read on here that Ally offers savings accounts with 2.5-3% rates. 

Sorry for rambling. Any advice is appreciated!",1

t3_bz3zx7,Quick Student Loan Question,"After reading the wiki and guides I still have one small question. Would it be best for me to get my loan payments as low 

as possible monthly and spend extra each month targeted on higher interest loans? Financially I can pay the standard payment I start out at ($1200/month), but if that is being spread out throughout my loans would it not be better to apply for the income 

based repayment to lower my payments as low as possible ($350 - $500/month) and use my extra $500-$700 a month to target my higher interest loans? Or would doing this have some weird effect on my taxes or loans in general? Also, lowering my payments if something major does come up I could pay that low amount and not have to worry about missing a payment.",1

t3_bz3wk2,Person to help me manage my finances,"Hello I am currently going into my Senior Year of college for Computer Science and I am horrible at budgeting. I recently went from 1000$ in my bank account a couple weeks ago, to 50$ now. I really need help learning how to budget because I feel like this will take me out in life if I don't get a handle on things. Luckily I have a job this summer and will be getting financial aid in the fall. The good news is I don't have any student debt , but I think I have 500$ in medical debt , and I used to have a credit card of 500$ debt from that , that got canceled. I was thinking about taking out a loan for a cheap used car this fall which might actually help me in the long run ( i spend a lot on food delivery and uber ), there is not a whole lot of public transportation in my area.  Is there someone out there that could help me manage my finances , where I could come up with a monthly or weekly budget  I could even pay them possibly.  Thank you",1
t3_byxnxc,House has nearly doubled in value in two years - to move or not?,"The housing market in my area has been hot. I bought two years ago right before the region took off for 229,000. I met with my realtor today, and he said I could easily list it for $400,000 - $415,000, and sell for 15 to 20 over asking. ( My neighbor recently got over their asking in the same range.)

I knew this house wouldn't be my 'forever' home. It would serve as a starter home. However I've been tossing up the idea of moving outside of town, and purchasing a rural property with acreage.

The properties im looking into are in the 600,000 to 800,000 range. With 15-50 acres. 

I'm looking in, and out of the county. A lot of the properties I'm looking at are not in a very hot market. However I could see a few of them become quite desirable in the next 20 years. As cities expand. 

Basically the only way I'm going to be able to afford this is (not my idea actually). Is my parents are wanting to move in with my wife, and kids on this rural property. That being said I've been looking for properties with a good split, so we would have our own areas of the home to make it work.

If I do sell my home.

Between myself, and my parents we would be putting a hefty down payment on the home (20 to 30 percent). So that should technically bring my part of the mortgage down to about what I'm paying now.

I've tossed up the idea of keeping my current property, and renting it out. The rental market is also crazy (nobody can afford these houses anymore). But I would lose the downpayment.",1
t3_bz3vov,"Budgeting for Student Loans, Savings, and now a car","Hello all! Thank you in advance for helping me out and for reading this post.


So as a little bit of a background about myself:
-24 years old; from Greater Boston Area
-I make $62k a year, ($3,410 monthly after putting money into my 401k).
-35k of student debt, and have brought it down by $30k since graduating with $65k last year
-I currently have $10k in savings
-I put $2,500 a month towards students loans, with the expectation to be done this year.
-I live at home, and essentially have no living expenses. My mother is a saint, and is covering my overhead so that I can pay off my loans. She will 150% be receiving a trip to an island once I’m debt free.

For the past several years, I’ve shared an old hand-me-down car with my brother. He’s younger, goes to school across the country, and is taking the car back to school with him this summer. Therefore, I am in need of a car. I don’t drive to work, I take the train. But I drive around a lot: to the gym, to my girlfriends across the state (weekly), to my friends, and my girlfriend and I do a lot of weekend trips to visit friends in bordering states. In other words, I need a car. We’ve been together for 7 years, and intend on moving in with each other (into Boston) once she’s done with Vet school next spring. With that being said she already has a car, and we would therefore have two in the city.

I know this is a little all over the place, but I really have nowhere ideal to turn, as I am being fed different advice by everyone in my life.

How much should I spend on a car? What kind of car? should I plan on leasing? If I buy, should I trade it in next year, or should we plan on having two cars? Do I take money out of saving, I’m nervous to do that because we will be engaged within the next few years and the cost of moving in somewhere will be expensive. And regardless, I should have some sort of emergency fund. 

At the core of this issue, I’m so bummed I can’t keep putting $2,500 towards loans. I was so excited to have paid it off by the end of next year. What’s a good plan so that I can still pay this loan off in a reasonable amount of time? Lastly, I’m nervous about buying a car with high mileage and something that’s old and will need a ton of repairs. 

I think I just need some help with overall clarity, as I keep looking for the downsides of every scenario.

Thanks again!",1
t3_bz3uuc,I'm confused about how to pay taxes as an independent contractor,"I have been working as an independent contractor transcriptionist for roughly 4 months now. I've been trying to figure out how to pay my taxes, and there's just so much information out there about it and the majority of it doesn't apply to me, so I have no idea what I'm actually supposed to do. I am pretty sure I have to pay quarterly, which would mean my taxes are due on the 15th. When I go to the IRS website, all the information seems irrelevant to me. I don't own my own company and I don't have any business expenses, because I don't pay for my internet as of right now. I think I might need to fill out a 1099 and a 1040, but I'm not positive about that either. When I look at these forms, a lot of the information is either irrelevant to my situation or extremely confusing, as well. And then, I also don't know if I need to fill out a separate form for state taxes or anything.

A lot of advice I've read suggests hiring an accountant, but I really don't think I should need to do that with my situation. Another thing I'm confused about is that my earnings will vary dramatically over the course of the year. I am able to work as much or as little as I want, which means that sometimes I'll make $800 a week and other times I might only make $400. I don't really understand how estimating my earnings works. If I estimate that I'll make $3,200 a month, but then only end up making $2,000 one month, what do I do? 

I'm just very confused about the whole thing and don't want to have to pay hundreds of dollars to a personal accountant when it should be easy to give the government my money.",1
t3_bz68h9,"Expecting a car insurance payout soon, would it make more sense to put that money toward our upcoming wedding and fully finance a new car?","On mobile. Sorry. Little background: my fiancée was just in a collision on the highway. It wasn’t her fault, but her car is likely totaled (waiting for a body shop to confirm). Thankfully she was mostly unhurt aside from some stiffness in her neck and shoulders. 

We’re expecting a payout of somewhere between $20-25k which is roughly what this wedding is going to end up costing all-in. We have set up a budgeting plan to save a lot of that money over the next year leading up to the wedding, but would likely end up putting several of the items on credit cards and paying them off relatively quickly. 

The question is if it would make more sense to take the lump sum of cash and put it toward the wedding since an auto loan should fetch a pretty great rate? Or take just enough of it to keep things for the wedding off credit cards? If we put the lump sum toward the wedding, we’d keep our current budget and put the extra saved money toward her auto loan. 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Edit for a little more background since people are keen to criticize me being willing to take out a loan... her car was 2 months from being paid off and the freed up monthly income was going to more than make up for any savings I’d come up short on with the wedding. Having to buy her a new car was obviously not something we were planning for right now, but I’d rather we get her the right one that she’s comfortable in and we trust.",1

t3_bz3k28,Bank gave my personal details inc ssn to my dad.,"Throw away and typed on a phone sorry for any mistakes and poor formatting. 

There is a decent amount of money in the account. Approx 150k usd.

My grandparents used this bank for at least 3 decades. I opened an account and had my inheritance  put in there. The account manager that dealt with them also dealt with me. I get the feeling that she has a target on the balance of her accounts and my account probably makes up a big chunk of her target and she doesn't want to see any of it go. 

I live in the uk currently. Account is in the USA. and the account was inactive. I had to sign a form to reactivate . Dad sent it to me, I sent it back to my dad who hand delivered to the bank. They refused the signature, and then proceeded  to give him the account signatory card that I apparently needed to sign and come in and show id. They then gave him this form with my address account number and my ssn. Surely that's not right. What should I do? 

I completely trust my dad and he would never have any interest in stealing money or fraud etc  but what if the situation was different? In the UK there is the data protection act and that would have been a very serious offence.

To make matters worse, I did eventually  go into the bank and sign the forms etc. Now any time I try to write a check or withdraw money off my card it they lock my account even though I was just there and reactivated and told them I will be using the account.

They also give me the run around saying I need to speak to this lady who never answers my calls, rarely returns my emails and only writes that I need to call her. She cant call me back due to her phone system cant call international. I've tried to get her to set a time that she will be free for me to call to no avail.

It feels like they are trying to ignore me to keep that money there longer and longer. I'm trying to invest it and they basically wont let me. 

Do I just need to go back open an account at another bank and move all the money out? 

Do I have any possible legal recourse?

t3_byx6k0,"Investing in real estate, or cash out?","I'm 30 years old, not married, making 100k/year in a job with decent benefits. I live in a high cost of living area, however. I was living with my father who was dying from cancer, and he passed away last month. 

The house my father has is a multi-family home in the city, but only one section of it is habitable. His way of life was to not ever update or repair his house, and he's owned it since 1975. The rest of the house has been a very slow process of fixing for me, I've replaced the roof, and fixed some of the piping, but the entire thing needs to be renovated. Most renovation estimates I've gotten have come in at 300-400k just to get everything updated and up to code. I've spent 10-20k just on the architects, expediters, etc to try to get somewhere with it, but the city just adds more money and more work to the project at every turn. The house was built in 1930 and a lot of it is still from back then. 

I have 100k in savings and I'm not tied to the area. My girlfriend is up for moving with me anywhere I'd want to go. If I sell the house, even in the condition it's in, because of the area it's in, the appraisals have come back at around 900k. I've been talking with a financial advisor who is telling me if I want, I can just sell it and invest all of it and keep investing the returns to have a good passive income stream for the foreseeable future. If I take out a mortgage for the place for 300-400k min., I might get 2.5k per floor per month and there's 3 floors that aren't mine (so 7.5k/month minus repairs/tenant issues). My advisor is just giving me the numbers but said the decision is ultimately up to me, but I'm having a hard time figuring it out. 

I see guys renovate buildings for profit, but I've been dealing with this for years and I'm honestly exhausted.

Even though credit karma pegged my Transunion/Equifax at 780+ the Experian report that the bank pulled came out at 697. The biggest impact was ""derogatory public record or collections filed"" and ""time since derogatory public record or collections is too short""

A little back story. 5 years ago when I moved cities I didn't change the utilities back in the name of the landlord. They remained in my name for the first month of the new tenant's stay. I was unaware of the bill was pending in my name till I got calls from a collection agent. I settled the outstanding amount immediately and filed a dispute with the credit agencies. Is there anything more I can do?

Another foolishness that I have done is since this last credit pull, I have applied for and approved for **two** new credit cards. These were admittedly very penny-wise decisions. I am sure these inquiries are going to pull my score further down. The second one I got approved last week would cancelling it help?",1
t3_bz2wye,Considering bankruptcy and looking for a financial advisor,"I'm 28 and currently drowning in debt. 

I moved to NYC a few years ago and found the cheapest rent I could, but it was still more than I could afford on my $13/hr salary. Pretty much all of my income went toward my rent and bills. Prior to moving, I opened a few credit cards to increase my credit score and make it more likely for me to approved for an apartment even with my low income. Stupidly, I started using those cards to buy groceries and other essentials (and non essentials because it didn't fully occur to me that I was spending money I didn't have.) I fully intended to pay off my cards even though I had no realistic way to do so.

My minimum payments now are more than my monthly rent. I haven't used my credit cards for months, but paying only the monthly payment means the interest on my cards has kept accruing and they're now mostly maxed out. My credit has now take a massive hit.

I started going to school over a year ago to eventually move into a better paying field, but I'm at least a year away from graduating. It's a city school so I get aid that covers my tuition, but it means I don't have time for a second job to pay down my debt. 

I clearly cannot get out of this hole on my own. My salary has gone up a few dollars an hour but I'm still barely able to keep up with my payments. And by barely, I mean they're getting later and later while the minimum payments get bigger and bigger. I'm considering bankruptcy but the idea terrifies me and I'm ashamed that I've let it get to this point. It seems like a daunting decision and I don't want to make it lightly.

I'm hoping to speak to a professional but I don't honestly know who I would ask or where to even start. Is there someone who would be good to talk to? I looked into financial advisors but they seem to be more about buying annuities than helping people fix their fuck ups. I've looked into debt consolidation but the monthly payments on those are even more than I'm paying now on minimum payments, meaning there's no way I can afford that.

Any advice? Who should I be asking for help? Is this the kind of thing an accountant could help with? Would a bankruptcy lawyer be able to give advice on other options in case there's something better for me that I haven't thought of?

Thank you in advance!",1
t3_bz04ei,"Future apartment changed apartment number, move in date, and increased price without our permission.","My SO and I have been panicking since yesterday as our future apartment we were really excited to move into has pulled the rug out from under us.

Our leasing agent called us saying that her coworker told her that we changed our apartment number  on our application and that she just wanted to verify our move in date. She sounded confused when we told her it was supposed to be the 28th. We were now confused so we logged into the site. There with our application was the new apartment number, and a move-in date for June 9th (THAT DAY) instead of June 28th.

When we called the ""coworker"", she stated that the apartment we applied for needed more renovations and she had talked to my SO May 11th about making these changes. We didn't even get the original agreement we wanted until May 30th. There was no way either of us were in contact with her May 11th. She also said ""You two really wanted terrace level, you two have a dog, right?"" No and no... When I tried explaining that we didn't authorize these changes she denied that possibility... She said she would look and find us something else that will work. Since then, on the site it says we are getting a similar apartment, except the move-in date is June 22, and the monthly payment of almost $200 more... Completely out of our budget.

We can deal with the slightly earlier move in date. But how can they just completely blindside us like this and change the price? We can't pay more than we originally agreed upon, and I have screenshots of the original agreement for the original price. I feel like they should have to keep their word on what we worked out May 30th. 

Am I being completely naive here by thinking this? We have been calling and they have been saying they will get it done, they just need authorization from their manager to change the price. When we asked a different person to speak to the manager we were told there isn't one. My hope that this will work out for us is pretty low at this point as we have realized how slimy these people are. Should I just pull my application completely since we really can't afford this? 

We're living in an airbnb now and panicking because we really thought we had our future home figured out, and now we really don't.",1

I've always filled out my W4's as single with zero exemptions. 

In 2018 I got married but up to this point never changed W4. I am starting a new job soon and I am trying to fill out the W4. My wife is starting two new part time jobs soon, also has another part time job (so 3 total) and also has a sole proprietorship.  Last year we got about $10,000 back in March and it would be nice to get at least that much back again next year (married, jointly)

If I just take the easy way out and have us mark zero exemptions on everything and ""Married, but withhold at Single rate"", is that maximum withholding or is there still a need to do the multiple earners worksheet for extra withholding? For what it's worth, my job is probably at least 80% of our total income. If I should do the worksheet and withhold extra, should we each do it on all the W4s?

Throwaway here but I've been grinding at getting my credit back together.

I have two questions:

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got my (closed) Amex down from $9k to $7k Canadian... it had been as high as 13k and had gone to collections.  I've been diligently putting chunks on it.  Upon receiving the payment per Kredit Carma the narrative changed to "" Bad Debt Write Off, Account Cancelled by Credit Grantor with Derogatory Rating"" - what does this mean?   The account has been closed for years and they've received steady payments for months, before it always said ""in collections/charge off.""  My rating also went slightly up when this happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I had a payday loan (I know) that wasn't repaid (I know).  I paid MoneyMart back in full after \~ 1 year.  They told me I paid them back in full.  They gave me a receipt for the payment.  There is now a company called CBV Collection Services saying I owe them $259 on behalf of Money Mart despite Money Mart saying I owe them nothing.  I asked them for written proof of the debt multiple times and they won't send anything.

At the beginning of the year, I changed my filing status to Married and adjusted the number of exemptions to 3 based on the IRS Withholding calculator. I am on an H-1B visa status and my wife has not held any job this year. 

Once I move to Canada, I plan on changing my W4 to withhold at the higher Single rate and also adjust the number of exemptions.  How would this affect the overall amount that I owe? When filing taxes, do I still file a joint return or file separate returns (my wife indicating 0 income)?

t3_bz2sx6,"Pay collections now, or in 3 months?","Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been reading this sub for the better part of 6 months or more and I appreciate all of the information I have learned. I'm working hard to build back up from prior decisions in my early 20's.

&amp;#x200B;

I have $2500 set aside as an emergency fund. This is growing monthly and will evolve and become my emergency fund + 3 months of living expenses account ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have the following credit cards:

\-$0 balance with Delta CCU (I use this for gas and misc. expenses, pay statement balance every month, low limit)

\-$0 balance with Amex (authorized user on parents account, they carry a $0 balance as well, this is new, 14.99% APR)

\-$0 balance with Chase (closed, paid off balance in full recently)

\-$1700 balance with Synchrony Bank (TJ Maxx rewards card, in collections)

&amp;#x200B;

Only other debts are my car, $4600 @ 2.25% and my mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, I opened the TJ Maxx account about 4 or 5 years ago and after making a few payments, it looks like I just forgot about it. I received letters but didn't pay them enough attention and it's been in collections for quite some time now. 100% my fault, I own it and I am going to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is this, I recently (6 months) started a new position and am making substantially more money. I have already paid off a few debts I had lingering (small balances) and building my emergency fund. I'm also able to invest in my companies 401k plan and start contributing to a Roth. I have had a few unexpected expenses come up in the past few months (all paid for in cash) from a $1500 car repair to veterinary services/boarding costs to normal life. My emergency fund/savings hasn't had a chance to grow like I have wanted it to.

&amp;#x200B;

We're taking a trip out of the country at the end of July, it is rather expensive between the traveling costs and different necessities that we will need while we're away. I could have paid off this collections balance had this trip not existed, however this is for my fathers 60th and a once in a life time kind of opportunity with my family. I have not gone into further debt/used a credit card nor will I for any expense of this trip.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts are, I should wait until after we are back from this trip and things have stabilized. If I haven't had to dip into my savings for trip expenses, the plan is to pay off the balance in full immediately. If I pay it off now, I'm cutting my emergency fund/savings to a very low amount with little time to beef it back up before the trip. Since it's in collections, it's not really affecting me any less by waiting a few months to pay it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be a wiser decision, due to the debt already being charged off/in collections, to not blow my emergency fund before an upcoming trip out of the country? Or, go ahead and get rid of this debt, even at the cost of lowering my emergency fund?",1

And there is AAA insurance, that offers me this: $1000 collision deductible, no glass coverage (windshield etc) for $1800 and $500 collision deductible with glass coverage for $2000. I have my savings, so I can  pay out of pocket and don't report at all if it is under $1000, but question is how worth is to be on low deductible plan if I don't use my car for commute but for pleasure mostly?

t3_bz2qyc,Help with decision between 401(k) or Stock Plan,"This is a bit of a novel, but I will try to be as succinct as possible. Here are the details:  


My company was acquired, and we were given access to a stock plan within the new company. The details of the plan are: We put in % each paycheck, and at the end of a 2-year term we have an option to buy the company's stock at a 15% discount from the price of the stock at the beginning of the stock plan. (Mid-Mayish if I recall correctly). My dumb ass didn't fully comprehend what I was reading and signed up for the maximum contribution: $416 / paycheck or $832 / month. Turns out you cannot adjust your contribution—you can only withdraw your money (exiting from the plan with no option to re-join) or place it on a one-time, 3-month pause.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm either stuck paying $832 / month on this stock plan which *could* be a great pay-off, or *could* be just okay. Note that I can withdraw my money with no penalties so I always have that out in I need it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the other kicker: I was on this entrepreneurial kick where I really *needed* the $600 / month I was contributing to my employer's 401(k)  (sarcasm intended). So I haven't been contributing to that for about 3 months now. Finally I wised up and realized that I should probably just take my free money (100% match up to 5% of my salary), and figure out a way to make my entrepreneurial dreams come true without that investment money.

&amp;#x200B;

So the final problem is this: with my budget, I can't contribute *anything* to my 401(k) if I'm paying $832 / month to this stock plan. In fact, the rest of my budget becomes pretty tight: $20 buffer if ALL my expenses land correctly (i.e. don't overspend on gas, groceries, utilities, etc) which can be pretty hard to guarantee.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have emergency funds, back-up money, etc but the pressing question is this:

Is this stock plan worth the gamble and the increased budget-pressure or should I take my guaranteed 401(k) money + ease my budget's tension a bit?

t3_bz2qmi,Roth 401k vs Traditional 401k contribution parity,"A lot of sources I’ve read have convinced me to contribute 15% of my income to my employer retirement vehicles.  As of recent, I now have the option of contributing to a Roth 401k which I plan to do.

So far my 15% has been going into a traditional 401k but it’s my understanding, that the money will be taxed in its entirety at the time of distribution.  As a result, contributing 15% to a Roth 401k would mean I’m actually contributing more into the account than the traditional

My question is what would would be % i should contribute to a Roth which would roughly equate to 15% in a traditional?

t3_bz2pln,Really in need of some advice. M (34) F (43) with no savings and 20K in debt.,"Hi guys, really appreciate any help that could be given, or some direction to do some due dilegence.

As the title says, we have no savings and are 20K in debt, about half to credit cards and half to private loans to a family member. We currently rent an apartment and would like to purchase a home in the next year or so.

Long story short, one of each of our parents had cancer, and it had its toll on us financially helping them out. We are now starting to make some steady money and seem to be in a place where we can finally start working towards bettering our future.

I would like to divide our money into the following: rent/necessary living expenses, down payment for a home, retirement, and paying off debt. What percentage of each should we be aiming for? Right now about 25% goes to rent alone. Our debt on credit cards has a few months left of no interest and no interest on the private loan. Since we have no savings and my wife is already in her 40s, I think we should prioritize retirement  (Roth IRA or 401K not sure which would be better, both self employed). Our credit isn't the greatest 650-700 range, so not sure what we would need for down payment on a house, but in our area it would probably be between 250-350k home. We own our cars already so no monthly payment on those and we aren't planning on having kids.

t3_bz2mkw,College loan vs. 529 spending strategy advice for new freshman?,"Our eldest is starting college this fall. She received excellent, renewable merit scholarships so we are expecting to pay $25K total each year (not accounting for annual increases of course) on a sticker price of about $72K per year, including tuition, room/board, all fees, and basic expenses like books.  

We plan to pay $10K per year as our contribution; the rest will fall to our daughter's savings, earnings, and some loans.  Here's how it pencils out per the award package:

$10,000 parental contribution

$3,000 student summer earnings

$2,000 work study (academic year) earnings

$5,000 from student 529 savings (current balance is \~$21,000)

$750 subsidized Direct Loan (5.045%)

$4,250 unsubsidized Direct Loan (5.045%)

\----------

$25,000

&amp;#x200B;

My basic question is whether she should spend out her 529 in the first two years in order to avoid the unsubidized loans?  The college expects her to draw $5,000 per year from the 529 to spread it over four years, but she could use it up in two years and completely avoid borrowing until her junior year. While she'd then miss the earnings on the 529, she'd of course be avoiding the accrued loan interest and origination fees.  A third option would be to borrow only the subsidized amount each year, and use the 529 to replace the unsubsidized loans while it lasted (most of three years).

Either way she will likely leave college owing $20K, but by spending down the 529 in the first two years she'd avoid two years of interest on the unsubsidized loans. That makes sense to me, but I wanted to get another opinion before we committed to a payment plan for fall.

Note: based on our income it would have cost her about the same amount ($25K family contribution) to attend our state university and we have no concerns about her taking on modest debt ($20K) for a degree from a good private school. The school she is attending has an 88% four year graduation rate  vs. a 51% *five* year rate at the state university so it may well be cheaper in any case.",1

However, when my main employer from last year (I do a lot of freelancing) sent me my papers, I discovered that there was something amiss. 

I worked doing polling for this company ahead of the election for two different 4 month periods. I could've sworn I'd been forced to sign on as an independent contractor but when tax season came, they sent me a W2 with a notice of only ~$250 paid in Fed taxes and showing that I only made ~$3000 across those 8 months. That's totally absurd.

If I was registered as an IC I obviously would prefer to not owe anything, but if instead I was an employee I damn sure want a full refund of everything taken from my checks.

It could even be that I did a 1099 for the first period then did a W4 the second time around (my memory's not the best, but lesson learned: photograph everything).

  I understand that the offering period in which I have elected to participate will run for twenty-four (24) months and be divided into a series of successive purchase periods. Those purchase periods will each run for six (6) months and in successive six (6)-month periods, from the first market day of January to the last market day of June each year and from the first market day of July to the last market day of December each year. I further understand that I will be automatically enrolled, and my participation in the Plan will automatically remain in effect, from one purchase period to the next in accordance with my payroll deduction authorization, unless I withdraw from the Plan, I change the rate of my payroll deduction, or my employment status changes. I may reduce the rate of my payroll deductions during the purchase period, and I may increase my rate of payroll deductions to become effective at the beginning of any subsequent purchase period.

The purchase price per share will be the lower of (i) 85% of fair market value on the first market day of the offering period or (ii) 85% of fair market value on the purchase date.

Whats the best way to handle this all as that may be a little steep for monthly drop in check. Will it be a smart to take the hit monthly on salary to get discounted stocks.

t3_bz1r9w,College Debt (Over 70k per year),"So I have no idea if this is the right place to post this but I figure this community seems helpful. 

so...I am 18 and going off to college at Drexel University for a five-year program for Architectural Engineering. Drexel really seems like a good fit for me but I need to pay 68,000 a year to go there, and that is with financial aid and scholarships. Regular tuition is nearing $100k a year.  I called the school and they told me I have received the maximum amount of aid for my program but that seems ridiculous since both my parents are disabled and I have managed a 4.0 GPA all through high school. I didn't expect a full-ride but I also didn't expect this. I should also note that I have no money saved up due to job hopping for years, my parents have no money saved up, only $600 to help cover living costs and books and are now moving in with my grandparents as they could no longer afford living on their own. 

I have confirmed my enrollment but I am considering withdrawing. I want to leave town like every high school senior but I just have this gut feeling that maybe I should go to community college since I am already enrolled. 

After five years at Drexel I would be $250k in debt if I didn't apply for scholarships. Drexel does have a good co-op program that can pay roughly $15k per year  to help chip away at the loans. I am also pretty confident I can get a job afterward. But with a starting salary around $50k, I am not confident I can pay off those loans. Maybe If I was making $80k a year but I can't assume that I'll be making that much. 

But if I don't go, I feel like I would be wasting time and my potential(?). I have thrown around the idea of waiting a year to go to university but my family is super-against that option and I was told it is harder to go to a school that I would like. 

So does anybody have advice on what I should do? Should I take my chances with being $250k in debt or just try to keep applying to other schools even though there are not many with my degree? Can I even get a loan for that much with zero credit history and my parents having bad credit? Is it reasonable to assume I can work hard to pay off those loans?

* Equifax - 757
* Transunion - 695

Last and most stupid question. What the hell do I do with the money that is now in my roth ira. What do I buy. I'm so lost.

t3_byvxm5,Unsure of how to proceed with our life. Need advice.,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and my husband is 29. We moved to a shitty town recently to earn more money. I just want to point out that neither of us have any education. 

We both have a full time job and should be starting to save $1000 a month, all the bills, groceries, etc is accounted for. We are also getting second part time jobs so within the next 6 months, we should be able to save anywhere from $12k to $18k. 

My dream has always been to travel the world and we were going to do that through goaheadtours. It’s a website where we make a $600 deposit and make monthly payments for 18 months and go to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for 11 days. They have around 175 tours, this is just the one we chose. That was the original plan. Along with, staying here in this town and saving up $30k to be able to move to Colorado and buy a house and just transfer from work to Colorado and continue working while going to school for veterinary. 

Now I’m not sure if we should invest in a house or if we should just travel. I’m not really sure what I want to do with my life. Sometimes I want to have a baby already but I know that if I do that then I would just be stuck here and never live out the rest of my dreams. I haven’t gone to school because there’s nothing I’m interested in besides veterinarian school and traveling so I’m not really sure how to proceed with the money we will save. 


Is it best to go travel the world or just pay off one of the cars we’re financing? I feel like I’m running out of time because I don’t have anything figured out, even though I’m only 21. Another option would be moving back home with my parents after these next 6 months, and start school there to save on rent and continue to save money without having to live in such a small town. The only thing is, my city doesn’t offer veterinarian so I would have to do something else and short term like diagnostic sonography or surgical tech. 

My husband was very keen on the idea of moving to Colorado because he wants to get into the cannabis industry and go to school to see how he can revolutionize the world by using hemp. 

I know it’s long and sort of all over the place. I’m sorry. But basically we can also transfer our jobs back to my parents’ or anywhere we choose to go. I just need some guidance on what would be the best plan. 

Thank you.",1
t3_byxxwk,Advice on father’s portfolio in retirement,"My father retired earlier this year at 67. His financial advisor had kept his portfolio as a “growth focus” that took a significant hit in December, but has since recovered. I told him to lower his overall risk profile to preserve capital, but his advisor seems ambivalent. He’s at about $382k, which is plenty to meet his financial needs.

I will say that all our current bills get paid on time every month but there isn’t much left over and what is left over we spend it.

t3_bz0av3,Thinking long term about a car,"A little back story. My car will be about a grand to fix. I owe $3946 on it as of today. I bought it for around $7k back in 2016. 2006 Nissan Altima. It runs, but the front exhaust need completely redone and probably many other problems. So I need a new car. My family growing up had problematic cars as well since we had no money. So I’m used to driving old/crappy cars. I want something that I can depend on for the next 7-10 years. 

My problem is though is what would be a smart decision. We have one child 16m old right now. We definitely want more kids. I was looking into a mini van because of the room in the inside and the sliding doors. But I want it to last me another 7-10 years so I’m looking into getting one that I actually want for a change and not just going cheap because I’m a cheap person. I want to trade in my car (trade in value $500) for the 2018 Honda Odyssey EX. The cheapest I have seen it is $26k with 45k miles. I like Honda’s because they hold their value and are made to last. Or their is the Chrysler Pacifica. Not my first choice but it’s still nice. I just hear horrible mechanical problems wrong with them BUT I can get it for $22k. It’d have the sliding doors I want and the room I care about. Just doesn’t hold its resale value at all and I’d eventually replace it with the odyssey downy the road. 

There is one more option. My husband wants an Honda accord one day. I can always get the accord now for myself and when we have a second child, get the Honda Odyssey and share the accord with my husband (Trade in his car which is nicer/newer for the odyssey). This isn’t a bad idea other than I want space in my car and I really wanted the sliding doors. 

I don’t know what to do. My husband isn’t much help because he doesn’t care and I just don’t know what would be a better investment. Spend the $26k on what I WANT and have it paid off sooner. Get what is cheaper and still good but resell it and get another one and have a longer maybe more expensive car payment. Or what I don’t really want at all but eventually get what I really want down the road and my husband gets what he wants. 

We were approved for $40k. We live in Ohio. I don’t want to spend more than $26k or less than $550 monthly. We make around $80k a year combined. We can’t put any money down as a deposit. I’d lease a odyssey if I did. 

Or I can fix my car 🤷‍♀️. But honestly, sedans with a rear facing car seat in the middle back seat and a 99th percentile baby is back breaking 😂 . It’ll be easier when he’s able to climb in it himself though! 

I want what you’d do. I don’t know “it depends on your situation.” I want what is better down the road because I have student loans to think about a year from now. (I will have $45k saved up from $55k in loans so it’s not an issue)



Edit:

Guys seriously THANK YOU. I’m leaning towards fixing my car but I have opened my mind to an older version of used car as well. I’ve gained a lot of knowledge from some of you about that. We will see depending on how much I get estimated in the final cost to fix my car. Slowly fixing it might work though. But if it’d be $2k to fix my $3900 car, sorry guys not worth it I’m buying a new one. I’m so happy I asked on here. You guys didn’t tell me what I wanted to hear and I prefer when that happens because it gets me thinking more. Again, thank you!

Do I have any way of disengaging my credit from her so that I'm not screwed after I graduate college?,"I guess my mom has opened several credit cards in my name and her's since I was around middle school age. My credit score isn't awful but it isn't good either. According to Credit Karma she currently has around $16,000 in debt across two cards. This used to be much higher and thankfully she has payed off and closed two of her credit cards, but she still misses payments sometimes. I get an email from Credit Karma every time she misses a payment. I'm just starting to get worried about how this is going to affect me and it is very frustrating that I'm going to be starting off in life with a rocky credit history. Is there any way I can distance myself from her debt, or am I screwed because technically the debt is in my name too?

Edit: after reading a few comments, I want to clarify that I believe I’m an authorized user on her account, not a co-signer or anything. I assume that taking my name off the account, as some of you suggested, will not improve my credit score but will prevent it from getting any worse and will take her debt off my report. 

I’m now researching how credit cards work so I have a bit of a better understanding. I will likely open up a new credit card solely in my own name to make small monthly purchases and immediate repayments until my credit score improves.",1

Speaking with the bank I'm lending with, they already said we make too much for any type of financial assistance from them, all they can do is give us the mortgage without any help.

Now, this allowed me to (quite easily I might say) get into the college that I was looking at. I got offered some decent scholarships, along with a federal grant as my EFC was fairly low (at the time of applying, my dad was working and bringing in around $50k and my mom making a few K for a family of 6). That has changed, recently, but more about that later.

So, I started off university by studying business. I thought I wanted to be a business owner/entrepreneur, so I took some business classes. I did very poorly. It was a mix of boredom, lack of self-discipline, and just an utter mess. I have no excuses except for laziness. This led to me getting below a 2.0 GPA (very shit, yea yea) and put on Academic Probation at my university. Going into second semester, I was going to try harder, but again my laziness got the best of me and I did very poorly... again. This landed me on my last chance of Academic Probation with the university.

I decided to switch majors as I realized business wasn't for me. I'm currently dipping my toe into Pre-Med (quite the switch, I know haha). To catch up, I'm taking a summer class. It just started today as of posting this thread. But as I was perusing my university's informational site, I noticed I owed $1200, due in 2 days. I obviously can't pay that (I have about $2 in my checkings and savings. I never learned to budget and manage my money...) With my school performance being absolute ass the last year too, I had a few of my scholarships revoked, obviously. But I really want to continue with school, despite my poor performance last year. Over the last few weeks and summer in general, I've been focusing on becoming a better person; managing my time, money (or lack thereof), and being more disciplined, and I'm really excited to tackle this school year. My mother also got a new job, so now my family makes a lot more money and it's harder to get federal grants and such as my family is seen as ""less poor.""

tl;dr - almost failing out of school, lost my scholarships and can't really afford to take classes but I really want to.

They have been there for me in the past and while I don't feel I owe them this, it is part of my personality to try and make things work out at least marginally better than awful when bad situations arise.

I will be refinancing my car payments into the house payments, and will be looking at roughly $950 a month on the Mortgage (this will include paying off back taxes and money owed as well as the car payments.)  Losing the $400 car payment a month will aid in this.

However, I would like to take my college loans that had gone into default and refinance them into a legitimate consolidation program.  While the loans have gone into default, I am making monthly payments on all of them, but a few of them have gone from $80 a month to $180 as of this last year, and I'm afraid the graduated payments are outpacing my yearly raises.

t3_byzi6q,Independent Contractor - Need to buy own insurance,"Hello all,

I'm in kind of a weird transition phase where I will be taking on some temporary contract work as an independent contractor while I wait for a clearance to go through for another job. I'm still relatively young in my career, so I'm new to the independent contractor/1099/w9 world. The company needs me to purchase the following insurance in order to enter the contract:

Worker's Compensation and Employer's Liability, Commercial General Liability, and Comprehensive Automobile Liability.

t3_byzg8z,Beginner looking for help with retirement savings / IRA accounts,"Very new to savings and investments and looking for some advice regarding saving for the future. I (24) opened a Roth  IRA with my bank (Citizens bank) a number of years ago to get my foot in the door of retirement savings. Currently I have approx. $5,000 invested in this account. I recently started to work full time as a contractor for a company at $17 per hour which could transition into full time at a slightly higher pay rate with benefits including a 401k match. 

My issue is that the rate on my IRA is incredibly low (.75%). I have done retirement calculators that say even if I max this account out every year until I’m 70 I still will not see any sort of significant return. Are there IRA accounts out there that have higher interest rates I should be investing in? Also, would I be able to roll the money currently invested in this account over to another account without a penalty? I am apprehensive to get into investing because I have very little knowledge of trading. Thanks!",1

t3_byz725,Buying land on the water in Europe.,"Hey there!  
So I've been a long time vagabond (my financial skills are far below zero), however, when I first moved to Denmark my parents who come from some money have bought me an apartment. They said if I ever wanted to sell that apartment, which I rent out, the money could be used towards a new place to live. I have been a long time living in various communes and recently have started my own collective with about 20 of my friends where we live on boats and live a sailing/vagabond lifestyle.   
We all are based in Europe. If I flip this apartment I think I can expect to raise around 100,000 euros, as real estate in Copenhagen has skyrocketed. I was wondering about buying a plot of land by the water in Europe.   


How would I go about doing that? What risks should I be aware of? What can I expect to pay and where should I look?  


All we want is a small plot of land at the edge of the water where we can build our own harbor and have a permaculture farm. I would really appreciate any help you guys can give me!  
Also, if there is another subreddit I should be aware of where I can ask for this kind of advice, please let me know.   


Thanks a lot and good wind!",1
t3_byz6oj,Can I pay off a HELOC with some other loan?,"We want to sell our house but we have a stupid HELOC. We originally got the HELOC ($15k) in June '17 to do some kitchen renovations (to make it more attractive to buyers) as well as to consolidate our credit card debt. Then one of our trees needed to be removed since half of it fell down. Then we geniuses had the brilliant idea of using it to make a down payment on a new-ish car. Then our dog needed stupid expensive surgery. And then another surgery. And then another tree needed to go. Haven't even touched the damn kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

We now owe\~$17.5k on the HELOC (APR is 5% by the way). Can't afford to pay more than $300/month, and most months we can't even pay that. We want to get out of this house but as I understand it, we can't until we pay off the HELOC because it's considered a lien on our house. A HELOC payoff calculator tells me that at this rate, it'll take about 5 1/2 years to pay it off. Don't wanna get into detail but basically I can't wait that long.

&amp;#x200B;

So: Can we pay off the HELOC by getting some other loan that doesn't prevent us from selling our house? It seems like a stupid question but paying off the HELOC has been plaguing me for ages and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of this sooner, so I get the feeling it's too good to be true. I'm guessing we'd have a significantly higher APR or something.",1
t3_byz6dj,Question/Assistance with Wife's Student Loans,"Thank you all in advance

I will try to keep this short. My wife's parents signed her up for college about 9 maybe 10 years ago. They said they'd pay for everything. They haven't paid a dime. My wife was molested about 5 or 6 months into college and she decided not to go back.

As you can imagine mistakes were made but young people make mistakes (not dismissing her trauma). The problem is she is constantly hounded by people trying to get money out of her. She works part time and so far her wages have not been garnished. What is the best course of action? Her mom is 100% white and her dad is 50% Mexican and 50% Indian (not 100% on the tribe) if that helps. Maybe there is some sort of minority assistance available? I know I'm grasping at straws but I'm trying to bring up any information that may be helpful.

She is not sure how much is owed but it is 9k-12k. Is ignoring the debt collectors the right way to go? Does she start a payment plan? Is there a way to get it reduced or completely voided?

It's gotten me interested in a loan to payoff my high interest credit card debt. I have around $12,000 in debt spread around 5 cards.

I used a service that offered me a 12k at 8.21% for 3 years, or 8.44% at 5 years. ~~There is also an initial one-time organization fee that comes out of the loan amount. They used the example of a $184 for a 10k loan, so the fee would be similar for me I guess.~~

t3_byyzac,Thinking of Renting .. What can I afford?," 

 I've lived with my sister for the last 4 years and have paid a very low rent. I'm hoping to be able to move out soon because I need independence. The place I'm looking at is in a really great, central location. It would be my first ""adult"" apartment that was really my own. But it's $1,000 a month.

I put 36% into my savings - 401k and ""others"" savings account (emergencies/future house/possible travel, etc.) approx. $1,100 a month goes into my savings.

Including insurance, paying back a loan, parking, utilities, groceries, gas, pets, etc = $1,800 a month approximately are my ""needs"" expenses.

That would leave me with approximately $380 a month left over for going out, having fun, etc.

So my question is, for anyone in a similar position (that rented something maybe a little bit above what they should spend) is it worth it? I'm used to pretty much being able to buy whatever because my monthly expenses are so low. But I think this would be great practice for the real world and really watching what I spend/being more purposeful about what I buy. I wouldn't be spending MORE money each month, just spending my money differently. Am I being too ambitious? Is this amount of rent careless? Thoughts?",1

She is refusing to pay it as well, as she's ""penniless"" (she's currently living with my older brother as she's dealing with some mental health problems.) My dad is saying, ""Fuck it.

I make a little over 1k a month, was blowing through my money like crazy until a few months ago. I've been saving 500 a month since I got my shit together and learned to budget properly. My necessary expenses are about 200 a month, and I got a raise last week so I should be making about 1200 a month from now on. 

My car broke down this weekend and it's being looked at today, but it might cost more to fix than the $900 I've paid for it. I only had it for 2 months, it's my first car and if I had the mechanical knowledge I have now I most likely wouldn't have bought it.

I found a hearse for sale, owning a hearse has always been one of my dreams, albeit one I expected to achieve way later in life. It's $3900, 101k miles but just retired from a funeral home, so likely well-maintained. It's across the country, but the company regularly ships cars to auctions near me so I'd be able to have it sent with one of those shipments for a discounted rate. I plan on having a mechanic near there inspect it before I make a decision, but if it's all good I'd absolutely love to buy it.

I have absolutely no credit history, and had been considering opening a credit card and use it for my expenses to be paid off each month and build credit. I'm considering taking out a loan to buy this car instead, this will also build up my credit, right? If I do that, should I still get a credit card? 

I'm going to a local credit union today to discuss my options with them, is it likely they'll give me a loan with no history? I don't really know how loans work but I've been reading about them, I'd like to put about $800 down and keep my monthly payments at $250 or less, would that be reasonable? I'll be spending about $400 at the vet this week and don't want to blow through all my savings at once, but this car is something I want very badly.

I'm set on at least the fireplace but the cheapest of these usually lies in the $1100 range. I just don't know if this is overspending my money - I'm putting about 10% of my budget into investments, 10% into a 401k, and 15% into an emergency fund until I hit approx 6 months of expenses, which will be about a year from now where I'll probably decide if I want to move to a different job.

t3_bykx1f,saving up for a house and my dad offered me 100k from his money market if i just pay him the 3% interest monthly he would’ve earned.,"this is a little personal finance and a little homebuying, so apologies if in the wrong space.

i’m in the beginning stages of saving up for a house.  my dad told me last night that he’s been thinking about this for months and offered to give me $100k from his investments that he’s currently earning 3% interest on.  all he wants me to do is send him what he would’ve gained in interest each month.  (could he be earning more:  he’s a bit older (65) and has pulled his money out of the stock market for the most part and doesn’t feel comfortable going back.)

the $100k would have eventually been left in a will and my dad was planning just to pull interest from it each month for the rest of his life, about $3k a year.

we’re looking at houses between 300-400k and this would essentially pay for a 20% down payment plus closing costs keeping us out of having to pay PMI.

i guess i’m still a little overwhelmed at the offer.  my dad wholeheartedly wants to, as he said his parents helped him buy his first house and he wants to do the same.  

overall, paying $250 a month to him for whatever the rest of his life is seems like a great deal, essentially buying $100k at a great discount.

i can’t quite see a downside, but was hoping to post here in case i might be missing something.  i’ve just never had this kind of help before.  is this a good idea overall?

tldr: my dad offered me 100k for help with buying a house if i pay him the 3% interest ($250) he would’ve made on it monthly for the next 20-25 years.

I was told that this doesn’t carry a lot of “weight”, for lack of a better term, and lenders could still view me as a credit risk despite having a good credit score. How valid is this statement? 

I was also told that buying a car with a loan and paying this off will help solidify my credit score. While this makes sense, is it actually necessary? Let’s say I have a score of 800: does how I got that score have any impact on what kind of mortgage interest rates I could get? 

I bought my car outright and it’s fully functional, so I see no reason to buy a new (to me) car unless it yields a significantly lower mortgage interest rate.",1

t3_byxvpv,Account that I had closed is actually still open and acured over $140 in overdraft charges. Help!,"Hi, back in March I finally decided that my current credit union was charging me way to much in fees, moved to a different bank, and closed the account. However that last step never actually happened.

Backstory time! It's not technically necessary but it helps explain a lot. You can skip to the bottom of you don't like walls of text.

I had called over the phone to close the account and after all the retainer garbage the woman said the account would be closed. I drained my accounts into my new bank and went on my merry way. I thought everything was fine, I had stopped getting balance notifications every Friday and had shredded my card and checks.

Last Friday I get a email from the community college I attended and they explained that there had been an error in applying my grants and one was left out so it would be paid out ASAP to the old account. Now since it's summer I wasn't actively monitoring my email so I didn't see this email until Sunday night and during the summer financial aid doesn't open until 11am Monday. I figured I would go to financial aid and explain what happened since the account was closed and the money would probably bounce back to the college.

Then the unexpected happened. I got a text from my old bank letting me know that there was a large deposit into my account of the amount from the college minus $139.95 they had charged me for overdraft fees. 2 weeks after the account was supposed to be closed an old $10 subscription tried to draw money which caused the account to go negative and continue to accrue low balance fees up to some kind of cap. 

Now the thing is I never got and letters, phone calls, or texts telling me my account was both overdrawn and still open.

Ok so I'm basically out $120 dollars because my old credit union failed to close my account and my college failed to update my info in their legacy system. What can I do to prove that I previously tried to close the account and get that $120 back. They have outsourced their call center so I doubt the person who ""closed"" the account is still there and the nearest branch is ~35 miles away.",1

I’m currently trying to assist my parents in their financial situation, credit card debit wise, and would like some advice. There are a few accounts open with high balances with up to 101% utilization on some cards. With that being said, is it better for their credit score if we pay the CARD with the highest utilization? Or is the score itself more relied on the overall credit utilization rather than an individual card? I am planning to employ the snowball method to help them out. I feel like that method would be best since at the end of the day, this is all a mental game as well and I want them to see progress and keep them motivated that way to get rid of all of this bad debt. If we were to pay off the higher utilization card, it would take care of one card fully but if I spread out that same amount of money, I can tackle down three different cards completely, giving them a better feeling.

Our biggest struggle is determining whether we keep the money we are saving for this time in a HYSA or to invest it in mutual funds, or a combination of the two.

t3_bypc5b,"Starting PhD, how to manage excess cash?","I'm at the start of a PhD program in a high cost of living (CoL) city. I am doing paid work for the university this summer at a rate sufficient to pay the bills until the program officially starts in the fall. I am guaranteed funding for the first 12 months, and will be applying to secure funding for the rest of it in October through the NSF.

I've lived in this area for several years already, so I have a good handle on monthly expenses. Beginning in September, I'll be earning about $2200-2300/month post-taxes (33k annual stipend). Housing costs (I'm renting) will be $1050-1100/month depending on utilities, and other expenses are in the $500-600/month range. I'm not asking for how to balance a budget -- for the HCoL place that it is ($8/beer) I manage to live within my means. As a 23yo, I fortunately don't have a lot of ""adult"" expenses yet. So net monthly outflow should not top $1700.

The question is, what should I do with my accumulating cash? I currently have about $8000 saved up sitting in a high-yield savings account (2.1%). I have secured funding for the next full 12 months, and will hopefully secure the rest of my 3-4 years in the next 6 months. My advisor has been at the university for 3 years, has already graduated 2 students through his previous appointment, and the lab is very well funded. So things are looking pretty stable.

I already have my ""emergency fund"" stocked at this point with my residual from past employment. So what should my next step be? Roth IRA, index funds, CDs, etc.? I'm leaning towards more liquid assets, since my earnings potential over the next four years is not too great, and will need capital when I finish my degree and find a place to settle. At the same time, keeping the money in a savings account feels like a silly waste given the horizon is relatively long (\~4 years).

t3_byu06i,Car buying help for college student? (How to afford a down payment on a car with summer jobs),"(If this post is in the wrong place please let me know where to post it. I checked Ask Reddit and it has to be generic.)



I'm a college student going into my sophomore year and currently in the market for a new car. The drive is about 160 miles (about 1 hour 20 min) and I'm looking at a used 2007-2015 Honda Fit due to the high reviews for a college student and the amount of storage space. The problem is that I have had trouble saving in the past and didn't work this whole freshman year, which caused my savings to go down the drain.

I'm currently working as a cashier at a grocery store in walking distance. So far I have been splitting my paychecks into savings checking, and paying off my remaining (less than $200). Once I pay off my credit card I have to also start paying off money I owe to my parents from some college expenses. I will then have another summer camp job starting at the end of this month when schools get out, but it's just out of range to walk.

The main purpose for the car would be to drive to both of my jobs, then be able to drive to school and occasionally come home on a weekend. I'd use it to commute to a job should I get one off campus as well. My current situation in school is taking an Lyft to the train station ($25+), riding the train ($16) and then being picked up, but I feel like my money would be better spent on gas, and that way I could also take as much as I would need instead of hauling everything.

The summer camp job is 8-12 and sometimes I'm scheduled at 12:30 at my cashier job which would mean I couldn't walk there in time. The money I'm currently making a month at the grocery store gives me more than enough for a monthly payment (hopefully around $150), and then I will make sure I get a job at school. The problem is that I can't afford a down payment. Based on how I need to split my checks right now it seems like I'll only be getting enough if I save every single penny and it would be at the end of the summer. I'm trying to convince my parents to help with the initial payment plus any dealer fees and taxes (with me agreeing to pay the monthly payments as well as the parking permit and gas), but because they're both teachers and wouldn't be making money in the summer it's hard to get them to help since they have to save their own money for the break. They said maybe at the end of the summer and I have to show I'm responsible, but I'm somewhat impatient and trying to figure out how to make up the money now before the camp job starts. I don't really have any other outside resources right now on how to make the first payment.

Edit: my parents said if I were to get a car I don't have to factor insurance into the cost yet. But I'm not even sure what else the fees and interest of financing are yet

I am a 22 year old with a healthy stockpile of savings, a roth IRA, and an excellent retirement plan with my employer. My salary is not great ($14.5/h ), but I have a stable career in higher education admin with good benefits no matter what. I plan to go to grad school in the next couple of years to try and break into the faculty side of the academy. I live in Montana for context.

I am currently paying about $600/m in rent, plus another $80-$120 in utilities (gas, electric, and internet). Rent/utilities are by FAR my largest expenses. A duplex has been listed for sale right near my current place for nearly a year, and is listed for $170,000. (Price was dropped from $190 to $170 in April). My lease expires in August, and I was thinking it might be worth making a switch and buying instead of renting.

I figure that a mortgage on this house would range from anywhere between $800-$1200/m, but have not yet run these hard numbers. (I have just used online estimators/calcs). I also think that I could rent half of the property for anywhere between $500-$600/m to cover a great deal of that, and when I move out for grad school I could get both sides rented for net neutral or positive.

My parents are also interested in possibly helping out with the downpayment and owning the home together, though I could contribute nearly 20% as a downpayment on my own. I certainly could get a good chunk if the asking price goes down below its current $170k. The catch with that would be that I currently have a good portion of my savings (\~70%) tied up in a brokerage account. I could withdraw that at a net-gain (since I first invested it) for the downpayment, but I am not sure if it's worth it. I'd plan to own the home more-or-less indefinitely and just continue to rent it out whenever I am not living there.

The net neutral or even positive on the mortgage compared to rent sound really enticing, but I am not certain if everything pencils out. **Is this even worth exploring in more detail**?

My next steps are: tour the property and look at the state of things; look into financing options; draw up the math to see if I could go even/positive on the deal; continue on from there.

What am I missing? Any advice or things to look out for/consider would be extremely helpful!",1

t3_byw8av,Calls and texts for a non-existent Talk-Talk debt now passed on to a DCA,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I was with Talk-Talk i'd say about 5 years ago, paid for the Internet and a Landline (Required for internet access). When I left the property I had to cancel my contract and after paying the leaving fee I had about 3 months of constant letters asking for repayments on the 'Outstanding debt'.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted the company multiple times, was passed from pillar to post and eventually was put in touch with a complaints manager who, despite being incredibly rude and short with me, advised me to disregard the letters as the debt had already been paid and appeared to be an admit issue.

&amp;#x200B;

After this was 'resolved' I didn't receive any correspondence from them for a good while, I believe maybe 6 months down the line I started getting emails about '£130 outstanding debt' I contacted them again and was advised they had no record of this as the account was completely paid off at the time of closure.

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely appalling company, and after that I hadn't heard from them in about 3 years. In the last few months i've been getting calls and texts from unknown companies/parties asking to call them on premium numbers, addressing me by my surname. Eventually one said it was on behalf of  Talk-Talk and that they were responsible for retrieving this 'debt'.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a text message this morning from MoriartyLaw (Basically a debt collector under a different name) asking me to call their premium number, after some research I noted this is directly linked to Talk-Talk.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, there is no debt. Any outstanding balance was paid in full many years ago and there was nothing outstanding. I received verbal confirmation from TalkTalk on no less that 3 separate occasions and I wonder where I stand currently from a legal perspective. They do not have access to my address and I believe the only information they have to identify me is this phone number, I would prefer this not to go to a CCJ but I am in no way shape or form going to pay additional money for a non-existent debt.

t3_byw76z,Help regarding collections agency.,"Hi everyone! I have been a lurker for a while now and have learned so much from this subreddit. My apologies in advance if I break any rules. I read the rules on the sidebar and hopefully I follow it properly!

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my concerns are in regards to a debt collection. About a year or so ago, I saw a dermatologist and got a steroid shot. That steroid shot cost $150 (I am in medicine, and gosh they rip everyone off. The medicine system is broken). Anyways, I never paid it. I was in the process of a move and overlooked it. So I know I owe that much. I got mail from the collections agency in May 20, 2019 with the notice of debt owed and account information. They are asking for $157.96 (which sounds about right, and I know I owe that much). After reading the lengthy information about collections on this subreddit, I called them. I recorded the convo after letting them know I will be recording, and discussed the debt. She said as long as I pay the debt, nothing will go on my credit. She also said she doesn't know anything about a ""pay for delete"". What she said is that once the due is paid, the creditors (who is the dermatology center) will be notified and nothing else will happen and nothing will be reported to the credit bureaus.

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, here is my plan of attack next. I read that it is very important to send a debt validation letter, which I will do via certified Mail, return receipt requested . Once that is done, I will wait for the debt validation from them and pay it thereafter with a check.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I feel like I am totally missing something here. Maybe it is a lapse in my understanding of debt collections. If a debt collection is paid, is everything over and nothing will go on my credit? Is ""pay for delete"" for when a debt is listed already in your credit? She kept telling me she doesn't know what a pay for delete is and by paying, everything will be taken care of. Am I missing something here? Please feel free to give any additional advice in this process.

I get student loans, but this just about covers my rent for the year, so have to work alongside my studies for living costs.

I've bitten off more than I can chew here, and I need help. It's making my mental health worse due to the constant worry of debt, and for my future. 
Any advice anyone can provide me on how best to get myself back in track would be greatly appreciated.",1
t3_bysikx,Debt is spiraling out of control,"Personal Finance,

My fiance and I have accumulated a substantial amount of debt of the years that we can't seem to shake. Every payment seems like the balance never goes down, and sometimes life gets in the way and we need to put something back on credit just to survive. We have been engaged for a couple of years (10 year anniversary is coming up), and we just haven't tied the knot because we can't seem to save any money. I know our spending habits need to be changed. We sat down and discussed our future and we want to purchase a home within the next couple years as well (sooner the better). Our credit scores are decent, mine being about 730 and hers being 760~. We also make decent money--more than a lot of couples that we know, but we never have money to do anything. This debt is seriously crippling that I've considered bankruptcy but that would put an end to our housing dreams for many years to come. Furthermore, we both have student loans to pay as well (IBR plan already). Realistically, due to our professions it would be difficult to get a steady second job as well. Our vehicle is underwater by about 5k, so we can't sell or trade it in without losing a ton. We still have a contract with our cell phone provider, so we can't drop that any time soon. We also have a habit of eating out all of the time, so we don't have a food budget it just seems to be a free-for-all at times.

Our budget is the following:

**Income (combined/after taxes&amp;deductions):** $4,876/month (not including the two extra paychecks per year each)

**Monthly Debt:** 

Rent - $1114/month

Gas/Electric -  $175-200/month-ish give or take

Vehicle - $392/month

Insurance - $150/month

Gas - $120-150/month avg

Cats - $30-50/month avg for food/litter

Student Loans (combined) - $455/month

Cell Phone Plan - $160/month

Cable/Internet - $160/month

Netflix - $11/month

iTunes Music (Fiance INSISTS) - $11/month

Gym - $22/month

Food - $400-500/month????

Misc/Entertainment - $100/month?

Credit Card #1 - 9.9%, $19,750 total, $394 min payment

Credit Card #2 - 13.24%, $8,200 total, $180 min payment

Credit Card #3 - 13.24%, $2,000 total, $50 min payment

Credit Card #4 - 22% (OUCH) $1,675 total, $50 min payment


I can see some improvements as I can cancel cable and cut that bill in half, and cut our food budget down, but otherwise I just see these large debt numbers and I become paralyzed and don't know where to start. I suppose start paying off the highest interest rate first which would be Credit Card #4. I was offered a Flex Pay option on Card #2 which I would be able to roll the balance of #3 and #4 into it at a 9.9% APR, but 3 year term and it'll add $130/month to our expenses. With the APR it is a no brainer, but I don't feel comfortable adding a $130/month expense. I tried applying for a loan consolidation/lower interest, but was turned down as they would only consider my income and not both of ours. Otherwise, I feel like we have more than enough money to live but with so much debt we are **not thriving** as I think we should be. It doesn't help that my fiance and I are currently living apart. I accepted a role in a new part of town about an hour away and I am living with my father temporarily until my fiance can find a new job here (she has a contract and is stuck there for about 4 more months). My dad does not charge me rent/utilities, but we are still on the hook for the other apartment obviously. In the mean time, we commute every weekend to see each other--I see her one weekend, and the other she comes to me. The expense for these trips add to our gas monthly average by about $100/month but since it is temporary I haven't considered it in the budget at this time. Can anyone offer some advice? Comments? Constructive Criticism?

t3_bysi8c,Partner at a small accounting firm reached to me to take over his firm in 2-3 years.,"Hello everyone.


I’m a CPA for about 7 years now. I did 5 in public accounting at a medium sized firm (tax, audit and counseling), then switched for a financial analyst position in an international company. Oh and I just turned 30.

I left my initial firm job because I was getting the biggest clients and they were all exhausting audits. I loved personal tax, company tax, compilation and reviews. The boring audit work wasn’t there and I was closer to the clients. With audits, it was the firm’s partners who counseled the clients.

Two summers ago I has enough and applied for a financial analyst position at a publicly traded company. Holy crap are the conditions good. 35-40 hr workweeks (no more 60-70), about 50% better compensation and a whole month of paid vacation.

My personal quality of life improved significantly. Plus both jobs are in the same city, meaning the compensation increase becomes all supplemental available revenue.

I’m definitely comfortable where I am and I could easily stay for life. I could stay analyst all my life to keep stress low (but pay then pretty much only follows inflation) or I could battle for a manager and higher job, but stress and workload would increase. The choice will always be there.

However, I do miss counseling different clients from the region. It was definitely fun seeing different companies grow and help their owners take important decisions.

This partner that reached out is a good family friend and my grandmother had a great relationship with his own mother. He’s the sole partner in an about 7-10 employee sized firm. He seems to have a solid, regular clientele.

I’m actually in a deep process of thinking. I’m meeting the partner soon again for lunch and will ask for financials.

I’m definitely not 100% comfortable with all of this at this very moment, because I’m fine where I am, but I see this as a once in a lifetime chance. Very high risk, very high reward.

Here is where I’m reaching out to you guys, any opinions?

Thanks for reading.",1
t3_bysf19,"Pick apart my plan: rent indefinitely, invest cost of property taxes instead of buy a house","My boyfriend and I were talking about our plans for the future, where we might like to buy a house, etc. We looked at the cost of property taxes in a few areas we’d consider living and I guess we’re naive, but I was surprised at how high they were. The low end is $4,000.

We currently rent in a neighborhood we love. We can’t afford to buy here, but we have a great situation with a beautiful apartment and great landlords. I was thinking, what if we just rent forever and invest what we would have paid in property taxes in the market? We’ll eventually need to rent a bigger house when we decide to have kids, but would still be able to invest pretty generously. Our investment would grow, our housing costs would be fixed, we’d never have to worry about replacing a roof, etc. 

We’re currently saving for a down payment. Say we put $30,000 in the market instead and contributed $400/month to it (a little more than we’d pay monthly for property taxes in one of the ‘less expensive’ neighborhoods we’ve looked at). At a 7% rate of return, we could expect our investment to be worth over $700,000 in 30 years (this would be in addition to our retirement savings). That’s got to be as valuable, if not more, than owning a house, right? 

Surely this plan is flawed since I don’t know a single person who has gone this route, haha. So what’s the downside of our idea? Obviously I know the market is unpredictable, but so is the housing market. 

This is not actually our plan, just an idea we were tossing around tonight, but in my head it seems like a good enough idea and I’m wondering what I’m missing.",1

t3_byt7xs,I need help. should I use bank or credit union if I'm using the account for temporary ( or maybe long term I don't know)?,"I need somewhere to put my money fast because I recently got a job and they only do direct deposit (also manager sounded like they really wanted me to open an account since a check is coming in for me soon) and I don't know if I should put my money in a bank or credit union. I'm debating about these two options. if you can help me decide that would be great. When I read through the websites the features sound about the same.  (Background I'm 17 years old (probably can't open a bank/credit union account, but I'm going to try and tell them my background story like I am now) and my mom is out of town now and I recently got a job for the summer. She told me to get a temporary checking to account bank account (anywhere else, but chase) until she gets back because her bank (chase) is offering her $350 if she refers someone in if I get a checkings and savings account through them. However, I might keep that temporary bank/credit union account ( I keep on hearing that big banks are bad and I should go with a smaller bank/credit union)

Option one:

t3_bytzvh,Weighing my options for a vehicle purchase in a year of change.,"I am considering replacing my 2010 Mazda 6.  It has been a fantastic car and has zero problems with it, and currently has 114k miles on it. I typically favor replacing my vehicle right around the 100k mark to avoid having to deal with any substantial maintenance work on them.  Our other vehicle is a 2015 Mazda CX-5 with 45k miles on it, which will be paid off next month.

I was holding off until we found out if we were going to be able to expand our family, and in fantastic news, we found out we have another little one on the way this year!  There have been quite a few things waiting on which way this was going to go, so now we are considering not only replacing my car, but also moving to a slightly larger house, while also taking on the extra commitment of additional childcare expense.  The good news is our older child will hit kindergarten next year and so we'll have almost no overlap in expensive daycare.  After accounting for a move into a slightly larger house and accounting for daycare expenses, we will have about $2,900 unaccounted for in our budget each month. We want to focus on more savings soon, since until recently all this money was getting dumped into student loans, which we finally paid off!  We've still been contributing to our 401k's and whatnot, but feel we could be doing better.

I am going back and forth on whether we need access to a vehicle larger than the CX-5.  I have already confirmed two car seats fits just fine in the Mazda 6, so really the only places we have an issue are if we went on an extended car trip or took a big beach trip vacation, which will likely happen a few times a year. By the time we are worrying about the kids wanting to bring friends along to places, we'll be ready to replace the CX-5 and could get a van or 3row SUV at that time.

I have about $10k allocated for a down payment, and should hopefully get about $3k more from selling the current Mazda 6. 

Some options I am considering:  

Get a lightly used Mazda 6 again, since I've loved the car and they've only gotten better.  I can get one with less than 10k miles for right around $27k, which means financing in the neighborhood of $16k at 4% for five years for $289/mo.  (likely pay off early, but our goal is keep our monthly commitments down to be on the safe side)

Going big so we have tons and tons of space to haul around baby stuff and go camping/road trips, etc.  I'd likely get a lightly used Chevy Traverse, which runs right around $35k for the trim I'd pick with 10k miles or so.  With the same down payment, I'd be financing about $24k, which equates to $445/mo.

Keep the current car and just expect to drop some money soon on maintenance.  I've always done the usual maintenance of tires, brakes, oil changes, wipers, but nothing other than that except a muffler gasket repair about four years ago.  I really like all the new safety features in the new models, so while this is definitely the most frugal option, my combination of *wanting* a new shiny toy combined with the thought that the new car will be safer are making this a hard choice to consider.

t3_byksrq,Please take time to understand your health insurance coverage,"After reading the post about understanding your workplace benifits I thought people should think about this as well.

The catalyst for me to do more research was when a coworker's daughter became pregnant.  Everyone talks about how great the provision of the ACA that allows adult children to stay on their parents insurance is. Well maybe not so much at least if you have female adult children. Come to find out most insurance companies do not cover any pregnancy related expenses for dependents on their parents insurance. This came as a huge shock to my coworker and myself as well. 

Something else most insurance companies usually don't let customers know is that if you can't find an in network doctor or specialist within a reasonable distance you can file for a waiver to get the insurance to cover an out of network doctor at in network rates.

Thanks to the two people who gave me actual checking account advice. Just because I think that I should get my money when it's been sent, doesn't mean I am a poor financial planner. On the contrary, I have a nice emergency fund, a fat 401K, plenty of extra money for fun stuff and an IRA that is doing nice. Get over yourselves that some people like different features and don't like getting screwed over by their banks. Funny thing is, I would bet over the next few years, more banks will be on board about posting direct deposits when they get them, and you guys will still be as irrelevant as ever.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: OMG get off the paycheck 2 days early thing. I am fine, I don't live paycheck to paycheck. I WANT MODERN BANKING and the getting your paycheck two days early and not just sitting in a holding account being used for the benefit of the bank only is FINE and doesn't reflect on my financial status. Sheesh!

&amp;#x200B;

After yet another issue with our current bank, we are considering leaving them and moving to a bank with more modern views on how to do business. I just don't know where to start looking and what banks would fit my banking ""wish list"", so I would love to have some suggestions on what personalfinance uses that hit's on that list.

So here is what I would love to get out of a checking account

1. Online web features are robust and let me bank quickly and easily - Current bank does have this and I don't want to have to give up my online features
2. I want to get paid up to 2 days early!! - Why does my bank not have this already, I don't know, but this is probably one of my #1 complaints with them. I literally have a small local checking account only for my car payment and they have it, so why doesn't my big bank have this!
3. Promotional start up reward - This isn't a deal breaker, but it would be nice.
4. Great customer service - Chat, text, calling, I just want to get a fast, friendly service with no run around.
5. No fees! None, zero, zip. I have direct deposit so the fees need to be waived for direct deposits.
6. Online only is OK as long as they have great ATM policies (fee reimbursement, big nationwide network, maybe even be able to deposit cash)

I already have Ally, a small local bank just for my car payment, and a big localish bank that has nickeled/dimed me for the last time.

Ally I do really like, but they don't offer my paycheck up to 2 days early. I know they get it 2 days early because my small local auto debit bank does, they just don't credit it until actual payday. Small local bank is bare bones with no frills and their online banking makes me sad, would not move to them. Big localish bank has yet again given me a fee for something stupid. They want $8 for a new debit card rather than a 10 year relationship. No credit unions... we have two local ones but they are so antiquated I would not want to have a checking account with them, even though we are planning on putting a chunk of savings with them.

It's time for a change, I just don't know what to really consider!",1

t3_bypnk8,First job - feel bad negotiating salary and need advice,"The title pretty much sums it up. This is my first real job out of grad school. Back in February, I was hired in a part-time position for a small company while I trained and got my credentials taken care of. The deal was that they'd promote me to a full-time salaried employee within 6 months (8/1 was the original date) if I got everything sorted and did well. Well my boss shot me an email on Friday to schedule a meeting for this week because he's been impressed with the job I've done so far and wants to do the transition now.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply moving to full-time salaried is a big deal for me. Based on the paperwork I was given, I'll be getting the following benefits:

* Rather than a 401(k) match, the company contributes 3% of my annual salary.
* Right now, I get my health insurance through the state. Our employer pays 50% of the health insurance premium. From what other employees have told me, this should save me roughly $50-100 per month compared to what I'm paying now.
* More time off and paid sick time. Right now I get 8 days off (all personal, so paid sick leave). Full-time employees get at least 10 personal days and 4 sick days.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing is the salary. The salary comes out to about an extra $4,000/year compared to what I realistically make now (roughly $23/hour at \~37 hours/week). Based on my math, my salary comes out to the same rate ($23/hour), but just at 40 hours/week. So, roughly a 9% raise.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner has been urging me to try to negotiate the salary aspect, but I kind of feel bad. I was having a really hard time before I came here, and this is the first time in my life where I don't have to constantly worry about money. Plus, the owner takes good care of us. He'll order a really nice lunch for everyone once or twice a month or will pay for a company outing (e.g. drinks, food, and bowling). Plus, it's a small company and we've recently lost a few clients. So, it's not like there's a lot of money floating around to spare. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I shouldn't feel bad about advocating for myself, since I could definitely use more to help with my student loans and upcoming moving costs, but I do feel bad asking for more money. Especially when I'm already being offered what's effectively a 9% raise on top of that automatic 3% into the 401(k). So, I guess I'm looking for any advice anyone might have.",1

I have a decent emergency fund so any additional savings I make go into low cost ETFs in a taxable brokerage account.

And since there’s no house or anything really built on it, I can’t apply for a house loan. I’d have to do a personal loan which maxes out at $50K. 

How would other banks compare to NFCU and what would be my best option?",1

t3_bys1pf,How to Live Off Of One Income,"Hello,

My fiancé and I want to live off of one income (mine) while saving hers. We don’t need to do this as we save a lot per month, but we could stand to save a lot more without sacrificing retirement savings. How do we live off of one income?

Do we merge our checking accounts, put my salary in it, and then put her salary in our join savings account? Additionally, what do we do about our credit cards since they are currently tied to our individual checking accounts? 

My fiancée suggested us keeping our accounts separate and just aiming to save her salary together. I would pay more of our monthly expenses. This doesn’t seem like it would hold us very accountable. 

For those who do this, what steps should we take to live off of 1 income? 

Thank you,

Update - My fiancée and I chatted about this. We are going to individually contribute money into our joint wedding, honeymoon, and house savings account. I am contributing about $500 more per month. We are doing some heavy budgeting and aiming to save her monthly net salary. 

We are still maxing out our employee sponsored 401k and she is maxing our her HSA. We are also going to put our bonuses into the savings account as well. Her bonus is twice per year and more than my bonus. 

We will likely join our checking accounts 3-4 months after getting married and continue saving her monthly net salary to buy a house down the road.",1

t3_byrwes,Autopayment failed on student loan.,Long story short I've been on autopay for a subsidized student loan for a few years. January of this year the autopay did not work. I had no change in my bank account or anything that would cause this and it's paid every month since with no problem. I work long long hours and rarely check my emails or phone calls. 4 months went by and apparently I'm delinquent in my loan accounts with no real notice that there was a serious problem. Like I said it's paid every month since no problem and when I found out that my payment was marked as delinquent I instantly paid off the fee. Is it possible that I can get this removed from my credit report considering the autopayment failed on their end? It's absolutely destroyed my credit which I have been working hard to rebuild and was going very well until now.,1
t3_byomzr,"Graduated, got my first full time job. Should I be maxing out my 401k?","I get that this ultimately boils down to personal preference, but I'm just looking for some advice here. 

I'm making 75k a year (salaried), and my company does a dollar to dollar match up to 3%. I will for sure put in enough to maximize my companies match, but how much more should I be stowing away? I live alone, don't have many expenses besides the usual, but I do have 35k in debt. 

Getting out of debt is my number one priority right now, so I'm thinking about waiting to max out my 401k until I'm debt free. On the other hand, by maxing it out right now at age 21, that money will accumulate quite a lot of interest by the time I retire. 

$19000 a year is over 25% of my income, though, which seems a little excessive at this point in time. What do you guys think?",1

1. Discover
2. Capital One
3. Chase
4. Regions

The first couple are online banks (to my understanding) which makes me a little hesitant because I'm not familiar with the concept. My current bank did offer online banking, so I'm assuming is something very similar but I could always go to  one of their locations.

Chase and Regions are everywhere, but some of their reviews scared me away lol

Saving Rate For Year 32.1% ($6398) without 401k contribution, 38% with 401k contribution.

I was hoping to get a house closer to $100,000, but if I were to get this house it really has the makings of a forever home for me. Everything looks updated and well maintained, and sits in a secluded area off a main road. The house also has most of the features I am looking for.

The personal loan would be from my mother. She wants me to get a house in a decent area and also is has room for her to store some furniture and other for her while she lives with my grandmother, which could be another 5+ years. Also she will be moving back to my area, and the house will be big enough for her to stay there while she gets something for herself. However much money I accept from her, I will immediately work on putting that much cash away in addition to my emergency fund (which I plan to get to 15k). The loan will have terms written down and signed by both parties, a copy each.

Honestly I could save up the money if I had more time, but my brother is adamant on moving out of the apartment and going his own way. I do not think it is advisable for him to do so, but that is another story. Anywhere if I rent by myself would greatly reduce my savings rate, and so I think the better move is to buy. My mortgage payments, taxes, etc would be less than rent. Yes, I know there other expenses.

House in question is 2,000 sqft (400 upstairs, 800 downstairs finished basement), .4 acre lot. Everything looks recently updated and well kept. House is in a quiet neighborhood and has quick access to a highway for my commute.

I am single with no kids, and probably will prefer to stay that way (especially the no kids).

My job is with Toyota Boshoku as a production worker and I think my job is stable for the foreseeable future. They are adding new lines and are having hiring events often. Not the most glamorous job, but the benefits are hard to beat (no health, dental, or vision insurance premiums)

So am I overextending going for a house at this price? What costs am I missing?

Also how does one go about getting the best loan quote?

Thanks for the help.

Edit: So personal loans are a big “No” when it comes to mortgages. Usually it is recommended to have the 20%, does that mean if I really want this home I will have to get a loan with PMI?

Edit 2: Could my EE Bond be used in the downpayment to make it to the 20%?

Edit 3: Another question, what if my realtor is the same agent as the house I am looking to buy...is that good or bad?",1

t3_bytfup,How will trad IRA interest affect taxes?,"This year, I opened up trad and Roth IRAs, and made the max backdoor Roth contribution.  I kept the traditional IRA open with a $0 balance after the transfer.

I just saw that I earned a bit of interest in the traditional IRA. Three questions:

1.  Does the interest comes from the time that the money sat in the traditional IRA prior to transfer?

2.  This doesn't put me over the max contribution limits, right?  Assuming this is ""no problem,"" on to question 3...

3.  I'm assuming this interest will be taxed, meaning next year, it counts as after-tax money.  When it's time for next year's backdoor contribution, I can just contribute the difference to the traditional IRA up to $6000 and convert it all in one go without owing more taxes, right?  I'm trying to imagine how *pro rata* would apply here, but I'm coming up blank. I have no other IRAs.

Example numbers if it's helpful:

- Contribute $6000 to traditional IRA (prev. at $0)
- Convert all to Roth IRA, Trad IRA balance back to $0
- Traditional IRA earns $6 interest at end of month

t3_byteht,Keeping Home Warranty as a Hedge Against old AC Units?,"Last year I purchased a home in Phoenix and the seller provided a home warranty. Normally I would be against renewing the warranty, but seeing that my two AC units are both 30 years old, I am debating renewing the warranty as a hedge against having to pay out of pocket for new AC units. Last year I was quoted $7k to replace a unit (honestly don’t remember if it was for one or two units) and I have a close neighbor who was recently quoted $11k to replace one unit. The home warranty is $480 a year, so as long as my units go bust in the next 10 or so years, It would be worth it.

t3_bytdqx,Advice on 401k allocations,"Hello,
&amp;nbsp;

I am a 31 year old whose company just switched over from MassMutual to Fidelity as a 401k manager, which has caused me to review my 401k allocations and just my 401k setup in general. I am wanting to be pretty aggressive with my investments, so I’ve been doing a lot of research lately into how to set up my allocations in order to maximize my returns. I created another post, and another user helped me to select my current mix, but I am curious as to just how important super low ER is and if a slightly higher ER but with better historical return may be a better option. I have approximately 18.5k in my 401k; 18k in my Roth IRA; 35k in some mutual funds (which actually feed my Roth IRA). I make 63,500/yr; I contribute 8% of my salary to my 401k (via Roth deferral) and my company matches 8% (pre-tax).

I am providing a few mixes that I came up with below. One of which, I came up with (trying to) using the 401k investment allocation advice I found using a ""Step-by-Step Guide to 401(k) Fund Selection"" post here on r/personalfinance

&amp;nbsp;

[Current Mix]
&amp;nbsp;

Here is my current mix, suggested by a user in the first thread that I created. The overall ER is 0.0252.

&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity 500 Index (FXAIX) – Large Blend – 45%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity International Index (FSPSX) – Foreign Large Blend – 35%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity US Bond Index (FXNAX) – Immediate Core Bond – 10%

&amp;nbsp;

[Financial Advisor Recommendation]
&amp;nbsp;

Here is what my financial advisor recommended, but I’m not really convinced this is the best option. Not sure what the total ER is (because I’m not sure what the ER of the funds within the BlackRock LifePath Target Date 2050 fund are).

&amp;nbsp;

-BlackRock Life Path 2050 Target Date Fund A (LIPAX) – Target Date 2050 – 95% (ER = 0.4; not sure what ER the funds within the target date fund have)
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX) – Small Blend – 5% (ER = 0.025)
&amp;nbsp;

(1yr = -0.154%; 3yr = 8.7225%; 5yr = 5.9795%; 10yr = ?)

&amp;nbsp;

[Fidelity “Very Aggressive” Model]
&amp;nbsp;

This model is terrible. It’s 1/3 in bonds, but I included it anyway because maybe the Fidelity people know what they are doing? The overall ER is 0.31225.

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Equity-Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) – Large Value – 23%
&amp;nbsp;

-Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Fund Class M (MWTRX) – Intermediate Core-Plus – 17%

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor (VMFXX) – Money Market – 5%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund (FSMAX) – Small Blend – 4%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund – Mid-Cap Blend – 3%

[My Attempt to follow the 401k Allocations Advice from this Subreddit]
&amp;nbsp;

So, in my likely poor attempt to follow advice that I’ve read here on Reddit, I have come up with a mix of investments that I think best follows what I’ve read on here. The first thing that I did was take my age and subtract it from 120 to get 89 (rounded it up to 90) as my percentage of investments that I would invest in the stock market. The remaining 10% would be invested in bonds. The bond I selected was the Fidelity U.S. Bond Index, for no other reason than it has the best ER (0.025%) and it has pretty comparable returns compared to the other bonds.

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that 70% of my stock allocation should be in US stocks and 30% should be in international stocks. So 70% of 90% is 63%; 30% of 90% is 27%. Therefore, 63% of my total profile allocation should be to US stocks and 27% should be to International stocks. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that one of the best techniques to select US stocks is to attempt to mimic the composition of the stock market. Something to the effect of 24% Large Value; 24% Large Blend; 28% Large Growth; Mid-Cap Value = 6%; Mid-Cap Growth = 6%; Mid-Cap Blend = 6%; Small-Cap Value = 2%; Small-Cap Growth = 2% and Small-Cap Value = 2%.

&amp;nbsp;

Since I am only offered 1 Large Value investment option, I chose Vanguard Equity Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) at 24% of my overall 63% US stock investment (15.12% overall). Similarly, I chose Fidelity 500 Index Fund as my Large Blend investment option, as it was my only choice at 24% of my overall 63% US stock investment (15.12% overall) and JP Morgan Large Cap Growth as my Large Growth investment option (again, my only option) at 28% of my overall 63% US stock investment (17.64% overall).

&amp;nbsp;

I did not have a Mid-Cap Value option, so I simply split the allotted 6% for this option evenly between my choices for Mid-Cap Growth and Mid-Cap Blend – 9% of the 63% US stock investment (5.67% overall) into Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund Class I (it was my only Mid Cap Growth option) and 9% of the 63% US Stock investment (5.67% overall) into the Fidelity Extended Market Index (it had a much better ER and performed better in most cases than the JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund Class I), respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

The only small-cap option I had was the Fidelity Small Cap Index, so I took the 2% that I would have put into Small-Cap Value and the 2% I would have put into Small-Cap Growth and put all 6% into this Small Cap Blend investment.

&amp;nbsp;

For the Foreign investments, I had read that it is advisable to put 81% into developed markets and 19% into emerging markets. I had no idea what “developed markets” meant, so I put 81% of the 30% allotted (21.87% overall) to International investments into Fidelity International Index (because its ER was way better than the American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund Class R-4, and the returns were similar). For the emerging markets allotment, I put 19% of the 30% allotted (5.13% overall) into my only “diversified emerging” option, Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets.

&amp;nbsp;

t3_byr70y,Customizing withholding on W4,"Every so often on here, somebody asks whether they can put down an absurd number of withholding allowances on their W4 to make their federal withholding zero and then just pay when they file their return. Inevitably, someone will chime in saying that you can, but you will pay penalties for under-withholding. Additionally, the IRS can request copies of employee's W4s from the company and investigate if somebody puts down a large number of allowances.

My situation is the following. I had uneven amounts of income for the first 6 months of the year but will be starting a salaried job with income well in excess of what I've earned in the past. I want to follow the prime directive and would like to build my emergency fund, then max 401k (good fund options in the plan), then max a Roth. I want to do this in order.

So my plan was to not contribute to 401k until efund was built, then divide 19k by the remaining number of paychecks and contribute that amount thereafter. This will make my tax withholding fluctuate. Moreover, if I just do 1 or 2 withholding allowances, I will be way over-withheld because I made so little the first half of the year.

My question is, can I just compute my year-end tax liability, and pay an unchanging amount toward it each paycheck by putting down a huge number of withholdings but then adding that amount in the space for ""additional withholding""? If I do this correctly, I won't have under-withheld so I can't be penalized for that. But if the IRS asks for my W4, I imagine they may think it's odd and investigate. Can they penalize me for a large number of allowances if I've added a reasonable non-under-withholding amount in the space for ""additional withholding""?",1

t3_byr4zd,When do I move out? (UK - Circumstances below),"Hi all,

I live with my Mum and Sister. They have poor mental health, the house is in disrepair and it greatly affects my own mood.
 I have just graduated university this year (hopefully, 3 days to go to results), to go into a job which would earn roughly 23k per annum minimum (not inc OT). Currently I work a pizza delivery job, netting about £350 a week, inc fuel but not car maintenance - though I just got a new one with emergency fund I had saved plus recent student loan (3K spent total), so costs for it should be lower as its only 10k miles clocked (spent near £400 on essential maintenance too).

 I have about £700 to my name currently. I have no other expenses beyond car stuff which is included in earned amount. I will soon pay my mum £50 a week for rent to help her with expenses. 

My question is this. As I am not yet in a big boy job, should I stay at home or rent a place local to get out of this house. Though I want to help my mum repair the house, I find living here affects my mental state to a large degree. I will still contribute to repairs after I move out, depending on need, I owe her for raising me and being a good mum.
 I can't say for certain when i will get the better job, probably a period of 6 months to a year. So should I move out? And if I did decide to, what kind of budget is acceptable to spend on a rental house? Obviously one with furniture is essential as I couldn't afford my own. Is a quarter of my monthly income acceptable or too much? 

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you all.",1

t3_byt7ih,Dinq on my Credit Report Disappeared...help?,"So I am about to close on my first house (used tons of advice I got from here!!).  The first time they ran my credit for the application the loan officer let me know that I had a delinquency on my credit report and it would be good to get it taken care of before final approval.

So I took PF advice and called the debt collector in order to verify the debt.  The person I spoke with on the phone either didn't know what I meant or was trying to be intentionally dense.

I kept asking if they could please verify this debt in writing and the lady would be like ""Well...it's from such and such date and such and such place.""  She ended up kinda being like ""okay we will send you the debt in writing"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, about 60 days go by and I'm up to my final approval and my loan officer asks me how I got the debt removed from my credit report.  I thought ""yay! I asked for proof in writing, they could not provide it, so it has been removed from my credit report!""  Except for when today, when I got a letter from the debt collection agency.

It's a very simple letter...letterhead at the top and what looks like a simple excerpt of an excel spreadsheet....my name, debt owed and a file #...that's it.  Is this proof of debt?  I don't understand at all whats happened.

t3_byoo7i,Should I abandon Capital One?,"I'm going to try to keep this brief-   


I have been with Capital One since 2010. My checking account and emergency fund are in Capital One, and I have a credit card with them as well. Savings account with Ally, which I really do like, except it's a bit inconvenient because you know, it takes upwards of 5 business days to transfer $$.   


Up until a few years ago, despite having a credit card, I always stuck to my debit card to buy things so I didn't really mind that my credit card sucked ( high interest rate, low credit line, no rewards). One of the reasons I never used the card was because the credit limit is $500, which is the limit they gave me when I was in college back in 2014. Recently, I switched to their quicksilver card and have been using the card as my primary way to spend to get cash back and have been paying it off weekly.   


The thing is, seriously, for the past 2 years, I have been trying to get a credit line increase and every single time they deny the request. I fly internationally at least twice a year and with a $500 credit line it's not like I'll be able to purchase tickets with the card. I have the Discover IT card now with a way more practical credit limit that I'm considering making my primary card rather than the Capital One. I have called Capital One a handful of times in the past year or so about a credit line increase and they say no every time. This evening I called again and told the woman my situation and how I want a card to put airline tickets on, and the woman at Capital One basically told me to go ahead and use the Discover card because ""Capital One's cards aren't right for everyone"" LOL direct quote. Gotta love that customer service.   


I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. All of my CapOne accounts are in good standing, I have a 720 credit score and make $60k a year. Why is Capital One not trying to keep me as a customer? Additionally, the idea of using a card that isn't Visa or Mastercard seems a bit precarious. For those of you who use Discover, do you find that it is just as widely accepted as the other two? I am so annoyed with Capital One I just want to take my money out and put it in another bank. Does anybody have any suggestions? Where should I go from here? Should  I make the switch to Ally for all of my accounts? Where do y'all keep your emergency funds?",1
t3_byppqb,Moving to NYC from the UK - Salary Advice,"I've had a verbal offer from my current (tech) employer to move to our NYC office. I'm currently living in Edinburgh, UK and earning a good salary (£60k) that allows me to have a great middle class life. I'd be working in Brooklyn and I'm looking for advice on what to expect salary wise. I'm treating this as a 1-2 year opportunity to live in a different city, so I'm happy to save less to really experience the NY lifestyle. 

Expatistan suggests that NYC is \~70% more expensive, so that would take my salary to \~130k USD. Glassdoor / Hired suggest that people in my role earn around 140-150k USD.

I'd really like...

* A nice apartment (sharing is fine, but with a 'real' bedroom) within 1 hour walking distance of downtown Brooklyn.
* Enough money to eat out a couple of times a week, and to live healthily (Not a ramen diet, gym subscription etc.)
* Enough money to travel around America during my vacation.

t3_byt5zu,Thinking about buying a 20% interest in my parents' house to have a rental property,"My parents are preparing to move to a different city.  They were planning to sell their current house (which is subject to two mortgages) and buy a house in the new city.  After talking about it with them, I think it could be interesting for me to buy a percentage of the house, and for us to turn it into a rental property.  That way, they could afford a downpayment on a house in their new city, while holding onto the old house.

t3_bykjzk,Pay off student loans or save for retirement and home?,"I currently have around $15,000 in student loans (all federal) with rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.86%, which is down many thousands from what I've paid in college and what I've been paying so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have a $1500 emergency fund and close $5,000 in a Roth IRA. My monthly expenses are around $2,500 and fairly inflexible, leaving me around $1300 in extra take-home pay each month. My partner and I are pretty good with money and follow a modest lifestyle with just occasional treats.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my late twenties now and my partner and I want to get married soon, buy a house in the next 5 to 7 years, and save for retirement.  We plan to have kids, but not for another 6 to 8 years. We don't know where we'll be physically living in the next few years,  but I would reckon we would want a home no higher than $200,000 (and that's really pushing it -- we'd probably go much lower). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a new full-time job earning close to $60,000 a year. Once I got the new job my plan was to put around $1500 per month on the loans so that I could get rid of them in around a year, but I'm reconsidering that given how comparatively low the interest rates are compared to what other posters in this forum have.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Does it make more sense to just get rid of those loans as fast and possible and the sock away lots for my retirement and buying a house, or should I pay the minimum (around $275) payment and save up for a retirement and home?

&amp;#x200B;

My gut and what I've read on this sub makes me feel like it makes the most sense to pay the minimum, maybe a little extra, but put most of my disposable income in boosting up my emergency fund then splitting money between retirement and a home.

t3_bymbk6,Can I leave a job after 3 months?,"Tl:dr: Boss is kinda useless isn’t making the changes that brought me there in the first place. Offer to double my pay, 401k matching, health and dental at another company. Boss paid money to help me get certified... can I move on after 3 months? 


So, I’ll start by saying that I picked a job up part time while I was finishing my degree that would transition to full time. The pay is okay, no benefits, but I like what I’m doing. I was hired because 1) a member of staff was retiring soon and 2) they needed to pump some younger blood into the office (I’m 22 everyone else is 55+). 

Here’s the problem, the guy I was replacing is the owners husband and she won’t let him retire because she has a shopping problem and doesn’t want him to be home going through her shit all day. This to me is ridiculous because she essentially has 4 employees but me and another could do the work of everyone. 

Okay, I want to reiterate I LOVE what I do. Like I genuinely enjoy my job and when we’re busy time flies and I’m enjoying myself. 

Problem two... and I know when you’re the boss you get to do this shit but it’s ridiculous. We open at 8:30 and my boss consistently comes in past 11 when she has shit to do and clients to call and we are losing business because of it. Her office is a mess, we can’t have anyone come in there because it’s embarrassing. Mind you another reason I was hired is so she could do yearly reviews with clients and spend her day doing that. 

Problem 3/4... okay so she won’t let her 72 year old husband retire, she already has too many people working for her (one of which is incompetent) and she wants to hire another.... she knows a girl who’s moving here who I believe is mid to late 20’s that she wants to hire. 

I really enjoy what I do and I’d like to run my own business (in the same field I’m in now) one day. However, I have an offer to double my salary (65k is promised with up to 20k in bonus potential) with health, dental, 2.5 weeks of pto every 6 months, and 401k matching. 

No brainer, but my boss has shelled out about a grand for some training and tests and stuff to help me get certified. Is it okay to move on? I don’t wanna burn bridges because I enjoy the people I work with just not in... a work capacity I guess. Honestly if I left I’d be cutting my boss a check which would make me feel a lot better. 

I just need to know if this is an okay move... I know it’s better for me but I can’t help but feel scummy. I’ve tried to express my discontent with her not doing the things I’ve asked or with the fact she hasn’t let her husband retire (he asks her literally every Friday if it can be his last day).

Edit: Thanks! I’m not under any contract so I should be free to go whenever. As long as everything stays the way it is I will be moving on in July. Thank you guys!",1

I am not interested in flips but more in long term real estate investments for retirement. He told me I can use my home equity to finance an investment property vs a traditional loan. Is this a good idea?",1
t3_byoso2,401k match advice,"So I just graduated college and start my first full time job. My company gives me a pretty shitty match, 25% of the first 4% I put into it. At least it’s something eh?I have two questions. 

It says it will auto enroll me at 4%, does that mean they are taking 4% of my annual or just 4% of every paycheck? I just want to contribute the minimum to get the match.

Does it make sense to only contribute enough to get that 401k match and then open a Roth IRA for the rest of my savings?

Thanks",1

t3_byq7qi,Can I deposit a BofA balance transfer offer into my checking account and use my personal funds to pay off a different BofA card as a loophole?,"I own two Bank of America credit cards (A &amp; B). I recently received a balance transfer offer for 0% APR til next year for Card A which currently has a $0 balance. Card B is was in the introductory 0% APR promo period which is ending in a few weeks and will be at 25% APR (its a travel card I got and had no problems paying in full up until recently when I used it to help ease my relocation out of state). Now I know I have incoming funds to cover Card B, which has a $2000 balance.

Technically, Bank of America DOESN'T allow you to use these check offers to pay off another credit account of theirs. BUT **would I be able to pay off Card B using my own funds in my checking account** **right now and just transfer a roughly equivalent amount from Card A's check offer** **into my checking account** to replenish that payment I made on Card B?

The reasoning behind this is because I'd only be paying \~$45 for the balance transfer fee and then I'd have an extension of time to pay off that new balance as opposed to being charged the 25% APR when the promo period ends on Card B. I'm confident in having the funds within the next 3 paychecks-- I was just worried if Bank of America would retract their offer if I did this since it's not a restriction for the offer but it's walking the fine line in terms of how I'm wanting to use it.

Appreciate any advice/thoughts in advance! Thanks :)  


EDIT: To clarify, this offer can be used as EITHER a Balance Transfer between cards OR as a Cash Advance / Convenience Check with the same 3% transaction fee for either usage.",1

I need to just fully embrace an approach (maybe the separate accounts or maybe the Mint tagging, but I'm wondering if folks have other suggestions or techniques that work well for them.

t3_bysbjw,Should we refinance my wife’s student loan to get out of a terrible variable interest rate?,"We’ve paid off the federal loans and only have the private loans left.  Problem is, they’re all on a variable interest rate and are sitting at 6% right now.  And because it’s such a high amount, it’s making it a pain to pay anything on the principle.  Is it worth looking into refinancing?  Our credit is decent, and together we make about $123k/year.

I love it and would rather not sell it but I’m moving and it doesn’t make sense to bring it. Since I’m most likely going to sell it, I want to have something smart in mind for the extra money, so I don’t just spend it slowly on things that come up. I’d rather have a new income/ asset of some sort.  I have no debt, I have consistent savings/investing. The home I’m moving from, I own and will be renting out. I know it’s not a lot of money but I’ve come along way from just spending extra money, give me your opinions and ideas! Thanks",1
t3_bys9ru,Understanding IRA--&gt;Roth IRA conversion,"Hello, currently a medical student sitting on Rollover IRA from my employment prior to medical school. It is worth &lt;$1000, and I want to convert it to a Roth IRA now because, as I understand it, I wouldn't really have to pay the penalty, though I'm not sure I'm interpreting the IRS website correctly.

I have no income as a medical student. It is my understanding that if I withdraw the funds from my IRA, I would have to pay federal taxes on it as if it were income. Since I have no income and the standard deduction is $12,000, I would not have to pay any penalty on withdrawing the funds?",1
t3_bys9qc,Purchasing a new home at 21 years old,"Currently, work for UPS as a preloader (great benefits) &amp; also working as a AMAZON prime delivery driver, totaling to about $35k a year. I have 5k saved up, great credit score (760) &amp; my only debt is my car payment ($120 a month), which I still owe roughly $6,000.

This idea came up because of the fact that my rent is $750, split between my brother and I. I would like to put this money on a home instead, if the option is available. My brother would be living with me along with 1-2 more buddies. Obviously they would be investing their money into the house instead of throwing their money away to a random landlord. I live in Boise, Idaho and I’m a firm believer that it would be a good investment since the value of houses (property) is going up, quickly.

From there, I would just rent it out as stated.

t3_bymhz3,"26 YO jobless needing help with career, finance, future, and life in general","Some background (you can probably skip this if you want to):


I’m currently in a bad situation right now. I studied for the MCAT after finishing my masters and bombed it. I’m very depressed because I didn’t have any motivation to study for it and at this point don’t care about medicine. I studied biochem in college and did a masters in something similar for no reason other than I was too embarrassed to go back to school for something else. My high GPA in undergrad convinced me not to give up on medicine and explore the idea at a later date. Sunk cost fallacy. Well I did, and failed. I know I can do well on the MCAT, but at this point it’s over. After you put in a ton of effort to get As in almost all of your classes, it’s hard to give up on that. 

Applications have already started and I won’t get into MD programs and to be honest, I don’t have the will anymore. I only care about having a stable job and moving on in my life. I’ve always been depressed. Medicine is hard for even mentally healthy people and you throw in depression, OCD and low self confidence, it’s a recipe for disaster. My motivations in life have changed from having a career with purpose to having a career period. It’s one of the reasons why I was reluctant to go into medicine in the first place. I was afraid of becoming a recluse in med school and becoming even more depressed than I was in college. 

I’m living with my parents and need to get out. At this point due to my tumultuous relationship with one parent, I can’t stand living with them and I need to stop being a burden on them. I feel like a waste of space. I’ve felt like that since high school and the feeling never goes away. It’s not just my current predicament that’s making me feel that way, I’ve always felt that way. I’ve always had a feeling that that mentality was the reason why I’d always put myself in bad situations throughout my whole life. I’ve always felt that I deserve bad things in life and it’s easier to just dream of good things. I’ve self sabotaged myself over and over. I’m going to see a psychiatrist in about month and figure things out mentally before I’m kicked off insurance soon. I could have done that years ago, but no I waited till the last minute as usual. 

I can put in effort in school like getting As but it feels like I’m doing it for nothing. Maybe because I was premed that was the reason why. There was no job at the end of the line. It was more school and depression (in my eyes), so I gave up. I’m afraid I’ll do the same with whatever else I pursue next. 


Now what I need help on:


My parents paid for my schooling. My undergrad was pretty much free as I lived at home and tuition was covered. I don’t have much debt from that other than probably gas money. My masters was around 25k. I intend to pay them back for this no matter what happens, but fortunately my parents were able to pay this without taking out a loan.

I’m soon to be 26. I have a masters in informatics, but the program was worthless. My PI told me the curriculum was not computationally heavy at all. It was just a garbage masters, but some of my classmates got decent jobs out of school. There’s some demand for masters in STEM, but I feel long term it’s not a great career path. I went through with it thinking I’d just do medicine anyway so no big deal. But I didn’t plan anything at all. 

Now I have about 20k in savings, but very little income. About 10k income probably from part time job but I pay for very little right now because I’m living at home and food is mostly covered. Once I become independent, I don’t know what I’ll do in terms of financial planning. Living with my parents my whole life, I always had a safety net and I’m clueless. 

So some of my options are the following: find full time employment in a field that’s probably dead end, go back to school for CS partly through community college, self study CS and hope my academic background (high GPA and masters) get me a job somewhere. I’ve planned out the financing of getting a CS bachelors. It would be roughly 20-25k, but it would also depend on my FAFSA. Because I have savings and my 2017 tax forms show an income (~10-12k), I’m scared I’ll get zero grant money. I’ve heard of people get upwards of $6000 and work study money if you have an EFC of near 0, but I don’t believe I would qualify. 

What advice do you have for me? How should I plan this out? I also need to understand retirement and I’m already behind my peers who got careers already when it comes to savings and retirement. What can you tell me about that?

On a deeper level, I’m worried I’m just sinking further into a rabbit hole of failure. I gave up on medicine a couple of times, couldn’t fully commit to switching to CS and now I’m back to doing the same thing. Now I’m also worried that if I do CS I won’t really succeed in it and I’ll be in a worse place. What if I end up graduating and all I can get is a job paying 60k and I’m too lazy to improve upon that?

Too many what ifs and I’m scared.",1
t3_byptvb,"What to do with excess cash as a young, early career adult?","I'm currently 24yo with just less than two years working with the company I am currently at. This is an entry level career at the moment that pays currently $1,660 a week before taxes/deductions etc. The company typically has 3% COLA raises per year and gives bonuses split between 401k and cash (totaled $4,000 last year). I am currently contributing 6% to my 401k Pre-Tax (with a company match of 6%) and then another 4% of my salary into a Roth with $10,500 vested out of the $20,000 balance with a vesting schedule that will be at 100% at 5 years. After taxes/deductions/healthcare this leaves me a weekly pay check of  $1,040.

Now, my current expenses are approximately $2,000 per month at most and hover around $1,700 per month. I have no debt except what is on my credit card which is autopaid every month in full. I am renting an apartment and own my car. I am currently sitting at $40,500 in checking, $8,000 in savings, and $850 on my credit card. 

With this I also have an EJ account with money invested for 2 years to date. It is currently a high risk portfolio with $36,500 value - $35,500 assets added to date. I contribute $250 per month to the account currently alternating between different mutual funds. 

My question is what should I be doing with the additional cash that I have above my emergency fund and what I receive monthly? After all expenses I add $1,100 - $1500 per month into my bank account. Should I contribute more lump sums into EJ and accept the higher fees? Should I be looking at roboadvisors like Betterment? or even other sites like LendingClub to diversify my return sources? Should I be looking at medium/low risk investments also or just continue with the high risk? I just at a loss at want is the right move at my age.
