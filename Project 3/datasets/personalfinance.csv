We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Review your investment asset allocation!** Some suggestions on how to do this:

* Gather data on your fund selections in each investment account that you have. Include any investment account: IRAs, 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, 457 plans, TSP accounts, taxable brokerage accounts, and so on.
* Figure out what percentage of your overall allocation across accounts is allocated to domestic stocks, international stocks, and bonds.
  * You can do this by looking up each fund at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), viewing the fund information on the company website, or just search for the fund name or ticker symbol plus the word ""prospectus"".
  * On [Morningstar Instant X-Ray](https://www.morningstar.com/portfolio.html?requestUrl=/RtPort/Free/InstantXRayDEntry.aspx) (free registration required) or [Portfolio Visualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio/) (after entering investments, click on the ""Exposures"" tab and scroll to ""Asset Allocation""), you can enter each of your investments and it will return your overall allocation.
  * If you use [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) and have linked your investment accounts, just click on ""Allocation"" under the ""Investing"" menu.
* **Don't panic!** Whatever the result is, the last thing you want to do is change your allocation without doing additional research, reading, and figuring out what you want your overall allocation to be. 

The goal of this exercise is to ensure that you're invested the way you want to be invested. For example, if you want a 20% bond allocation, is that what you have? If you want 35% of your stock investments to be international, are you reasonably close to that? (These are just examples, not recommendations.)

For more information on allocations, here are some recommended readings:

* [From our Investing Wiki: Can you just recommend something extreme specific to get me started?](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_can_you_just_recommend_something_extremely_specific_to_get_me_started.3F)
* [From our Investing Wiki: What bond percentage should I have?](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_what_bond_percentage_should_i_have.3F)
* [From our wiki: 401(k) fund selection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds)  
* [Boglehead background reading on asset allocation](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation)

Use the comments to discuss your allocation, any questions you might have, or if you're wondering what you can do about them.               

Now is also a great time to make a [Personal Financial Statement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/personal-financial-statement.asp). These are used to track financial health over time, so keep your past records accessible in the spreadsheet program of your choice.

t3_bz333z,A tip for your car payoff and credit score,"Perhaps I am naive to the ways of the world, but I thought I’d share my life lesson here for others who might meet the same fate as I.  CHECK YOUR AUTO LOAN!  CHECK YOUR CREDIT SCORE! 

My SO (then BF/now husband) picked out a new (er) car for me once we were engaged.  I’d driven the car my parents got when I was 15 since I was 16.  It was a Sunfire and let’s be real...after 12 years of me driving it and 1 year of my parents driving it...it was time to go.  

I had great credit and qualified easily for a loan and set up payments with the loaning bank for automatic bill pay.  I got the car five years ago and was very excited knowing it would be paid off at the start of this year.  Over the past 5 years since  making the purchase I have gotten married, bought a forever home, had a child, and am pregnant with our second.  I’m pretty on top of things and in charge of finances as my husband is notoriously bad with money.  This January I see the car payment come out and read up on paying off an auto loan.  I learned that sometimes a credit score will drop right after a big loan is paid off, but that it will bounce back within a few months.  

Cue February.  No car payment comes out.  No worries.  I knew we had one or two payments left on the car so I assumed the final payment was made!  Yay!  I checked my credit score on credit karma to find that my score dropped some, but it was to be expected.  I am now over the moon to have completed my first car loan!  

Today I decided to check my score again to see if it had in fact bounced back up.  To my horror I discover my score has fallen an additional 78 points!  I start digging and discover the car loan is claiming I never made the last payment.  After being up all night with anxiety about the situation I get in contact with the bank this morning.  It turns out that this bank ONLY accepts the final payment via phone or mail even with auto bill pay set up.  This bank also will not let you set up online banking with them unless you also open a checking account with them.  A loan account alone will not suffice.  

So the moral of the story is that despite being extremely financially responsible and doing everything I thought I should be doing - shit happens I guess.  Make sure your final loan payment meets all the requirements of the bank and do not assume that auto bill pay ensures that your bill is paid.  

Side note: this bank also does not send paper OR email OR phone notices when a payment is missed.  So despite 5 years of on time payments - there was no notification that the final payment did not occur.  It was only checking my credit score that alerted me to the situation.  Had I not checked it I hate to think the outcome given the account was now 90 days late.  So now I’m coming to grips with my “fair” credit score and mostly thankful that I have no major purchases in the near future where my score would be needed.  

TLDR:  make sure your final loan payment does not have to be made via phone or mail.  It turns it that auto bill pay does not necessarily mean that payment is made if the bank has stipulations saying otherwise.

Edit:  Bank is BMO Harris.  It is not local to me.

Edit 2: For those asking - I live in Illinois where it has taken 2 months to get a new drivers license mailed to me.  Where it takes months and months to renew a FOID card despite the only change being that you are a few years older and actually had it updated three years earlier when changing last names.  This was my first car loan and I had no prior knowledge on the timeframe needed to process a legal document given how long everything else in this state takes.  I had decided to reach out or look into it more if I didn’t get anything within the next month or so when all this went down.  I’m feeling rather foolish about the entire thing and hope that sharing can help some others from potentially going down the same path.",1
t3_bz1k49,Gf moving into my place soon. Is it wise to write a contract for monthly expenses?,"I own my condo and keep up with all my expenses, including student loan repayments. Slowly paying down my CC debt. All in all, while it’s nowhere near as fast as I would like, I’m doing ok and making progress.

My girlfriend of almost a year is moving in with me in the next couple months. She’s already been staying at my place for most of the week, we’re just waiting for her lease to end. We’ve had some great conversations about the expenses, splitting my mortgage payments, utilities, etc etc. We even got under $200 a month for groceries! We have not started the major payments, though, since she’s still shelling out rent on her apartment. 

My question is, should I try to get some sort of contract figured out with her before she formerly moves in, with a breakdown of what we agree to? Eg., the mortgage, internet, utilities, groceries, etc? On the one hand, I can’t imagine significant others enjoy having that conversation. On the other, I’ve heard too many “Judge Judy” level horror stories to just blow it off. May also X post in relationship advice.

TLDR: Should I draft a contract with my gf before she moves into my condo? What should be included in the contract, and how would you approach it with an SO?

Virginia, if that makes a difference.

UPDATE: Holy crap this got more traction than I was expecting. I can’t keep up with the replies, so I’ll try to summarize some issues here;

Communication: thanks to everyone that mentioned this one! We’re both social workers, so it always comes back to communication, anyways. 

Trust: I want to be clear, I have no questions about trusting her. I really am inexperienced with roommates and splitting expenses. I have no idea what the prevailing wisdom is, but got a boatload here!

Equity: Excellent point! I hadn’t considered how much I would benefit from that, versus her monthly decrease in “rent” payments. This’ll be the place to start in future conversations.

To everyone that’s chiming in here or the other post, thank you! Even (especially?) the more angry/offended contributors. You’ve done a hell of a job on driving home the magnitude of the potential consequences, whatever decision is made.

To be clear, my wording sucked, and she’s not actually paying my mortgage, nor are we combining finances. What we had agreed to was a fixed amount per month which includes half the utilities, internet, HOA, and mortgage equivalent. That mortgage sum will change, for sure. That total amount is still $200 less than her current rent. I’m not looking to profit from this arrangement. I’m just psyched up that we get to do this together, and benefit together. She falls asleep next to me in 5 minutes flat. I can’t put a dollar value on that, and don’t want to disrupt it, either.",1
t3_bys7jk,"If you haven't filed your US Federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by June 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.","Taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. Ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (FTF), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. This penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

If a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the April due date -- or more than 60 days after the October due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. This means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. If the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. The late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

The FTF penalty does not apply to the Taxpayers who met this year’s April 15 deadline to file their individual tax return. It also won’t apply to the Taxpayers who asked the IRS for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by Oct. 15, 2019.

In addition, the IRS urges Taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. The late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (FTP), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. Interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original April 15 deadline.

After a return is filed, the IRS will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. Normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

If you are *claiming a refund* on your federal return and filing late, there is generally no penalty or interest charge.

t3_bz7zkl,"Dad totaled my new car, how screwed am I?","Hi y'all, 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this, but I need some advice.

This weekend, my dad took my car while I was out of the house and totaled it. He just ran it off the road, no other people or vehicles involved. He has insurance but doesn't seem to want to take responsibility. I am under separate insurance. 

I literally just purchased this car 2 months ago and still owe around $14,000 on it. What are the next steps? This is my first car so I am feeling pretty lost. Thanks in advance.

E: I worded this badly - he didn’t steal my car. I left him the keys to use as needed",1
t3_bz88ru,I made a huge mistake by taking out a payday loan,"To keep this brief, I had to take out a payday loan to make rent last month. In hindsight, this was a bad idea, as I would've come out WAY cheaper just paying the late fees on my rent. Anyways, I signed up for a payday loan through Speedy Cash for $425. I didn't read the contract before signing (I know, major facepalm) and I've just come to realize that not only will I be paying back $1,309 due to interest, but also an additional one-time payment of $564.26 in principal and CAB fees. $1873.26 for a $425 loan, $119 out of every check I receive for the next 6 months. Is there any way I can lower this? Is there anything I can do at all to avoid repaying such an egregious amount? I know I really messed up by not simply *reading the contract before signing* but surely there's something I can do, right?

EDIT: I want to add that I looked in to refinancing the loan, but the Speedy Cash website is extremely ambiguous. Whenever I go to the refinance tab, I get no information on what my payment amount would be changed to, when my new due date would be, or what my new interest rates would be. The site refuses to give that information until after I have agreed to refinance and paid a fee.",1
t3_bz77m2,Payed off my credit card with 1 day left on the “no interest” charge!,"Yeah, so I feel like a bad ass. I got a new ac last spring with the Home Depot “no interest for 18 months” credit card and I paid it off with 1 day left before my accrued interest, $3000, kicked in. And I didn’t dip into my savings to do it! Im delighted with myself!",1
t3_bzaptw,[Mortgage] Question on bank refusing partial payments,"Hi All,

Apologies as I know this is covered but I'm still confused. Perhaps this a little bit of an ELI5 moment.

I see posts like: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/53zdmu/bank_told_me_they_wont_accept_partial_mortgage/

Users there want banks to accept partial payments and credit them. I understand why the bank doesn't want to do that. I also understand how banks can refused to accept partial payments if the payments are late etc. 

To me partial payments implies that you're only making part of the payment not simply splitting the funds into two literal payments. Am I incorrect in this understanding?

Can you explain how a bank isn't required to accept literally split payments for the monthly payment? Let's say I owe $100 monthly payment. If I sent $50 from one bank account and $50 from another why are they allowed to refuse to accept the payment against the monthly payment?

I'm asking because I sent two payments due to being overseas (trying to figure out banking while overseas is not easy). The banks website payment &amp; some other features don't work when abroad even when using VPN for some strange reason it keeps timing out which I assume is a security measure. 

Anyways I submitted two payments and emailed asking them to be combined to pay the monthly payment. They told me they couldn't / wouldn't do this and applied the payments to the principal. 

Being very in PF this isn't a big deal aka I can just send another payment of the full amount before the payment is late but TBH I was surprised. It seemed like a small request. I wasn't asking them to do special crediting, I've been paying on time for forever, and adding $50 + $50 especially when told before the payment hits seems like a small ask. TBH I was surprised this was even legal as it's still legal tender against a loan. I used to work for a lending company and TMK this was never an issue. Lenders usually want their money and don't really care if you want to make it in 2 ACH payments or 1.

Is this just a mortgage servicers can do what they want because you signed a contract? I actually had my loan transferred to them (Cenlar) from Citi. Citi was always easy to use in comparison.",1
t3_bz5nxz,The cost of a NICU stay in the US(CA),I had an emergency C section back in February with my daughter. She was air lifted to a hospital with a higher level NICU and stayed for 66 days. [This](https://imgur.com/a/6FMCIQ1) is the EOB I just received after 4 months now that all the claims have settled. I’m very grateful I have great insurance and it’s not what I’m actually responsible for.,1
t3_byy9lp,My husband and I (25) feel so stuck in our finances. Please advise!,"We are 25. I just graduated college and got my first job (teacher) making $33,500. 
Husband has no degree, works as a manager at a trucking company and makes $40,000. 
Our monthly take home pay is about $4,300. 
 
This is our bill break down: 

Mortgage: 800

Truck: 450

Tractor (we live on land): 350

Car insurance: 250

Electric/water/gas: 200

Student loans: 550

Subscriptions (Netflix/gym/etc): 50

Gas (we both commute): 450

Groceries: 500

Credit card: 200

Hospital bills: 200 

House repairs: 150

Total: $4150 

So we should have $200 for savings, but just in general, life happens and it always gets used up. Usually traveling to visit mine or his family. About our house: we bought it 2 years ago for $90,000, no down payment (dumb). I think that is why our payment is so high. It is in need of major work (no floors on some spots, walls coming down), but luckily we do have some equity (~7% in it). We have thought about refinancing, and getting a home improvement loan to fix it, and making sure that when it is done we have 20% equity in it, so we could get out of PMI. I don’t think it would make our payment cheaper, because then it would be more like a $120,000 loan, but at least it would be more of an acceptable living space. I’m not into finance so I’m not sure how much any of this makes sense. 
We just have no cash flow to get anything accomplished, which we need to get the house assessed if that is what we want to do. My car is on its last leg, luckily my husband can mechanic pretty good, but there’s only so much he can do for a 25 year old beater. I feel like we don’t live an extravagant life, and I know there are people worse off, but we just want to be able to put some money into savings and still have some left over for spending each month. I feel like we work pretty hard for nothing you know? I got a job this summer since schools not in session, and I’m hoping to finally save up for a vacuum cleaner lol. I’ve applied for an after school position next year, and hopefully I’ll get it and it’ll bring in some extra income.  
Anyways. Sorry if this is not the right place! I’m newish to Reddit and definitely new to this sub! 
Thanks!!!

Edit: wow! Thank you all for the replies and advice! I thought I could reply to it all but I can’t, but I promise I did read everything. It may take 6 months to a year for us to get back on track but I can assure you we’re going to do everything we can, and I’ll update then! 
I think tractor is going to be first to go. We will lose a little bit of money on it and then we’re going to buy a mower just to mow the lawn. Have not discussed the truck at all yet but maybe to come in. Going to work on budgeting my groceries better and cutting down on spending there. We’re working on fixing up an old junk car we had and is soon as it can be sold all of that will go to pay off the credit card bill and hospital bills. Also some really great advice we’re shopping around for some cheaper insurance and I’ve already gotten some really good quotes. It’s crazy what you can accomplish in just one day looking at budget with the help of people online. I know a lot of people probably read my post and thought that we were just stupid and immature with our money but an actual reality we just didn’t know what to do and got in over our heads before we did any kind of research. I thought that was a reasonable truck payment and we both felt at the time that a tractor was what we needed but we’re both trying to come to terms and learning a lot today. Have not shown my husband this thread he doesn’t really get reddit if you know what I mean but I have been talking to about finances today, he’s wondering why all the sudden I’m so interested: It basically boils down to I want to freaking vacuum cleaner ha ha! But for real I can live with a broom and a dustpan for another year if we can get our finances under control and put money towards that and savings thanks again!
P.S. sorry if I came off as rude or passive aggressive! Honestly just embarrassed and glad Reddit is anonymous. I really appreciate people taking time out of their day to help me.",1
t3_bzbe8h,Received an unsolicited raise due to a pay discrepancy - how do I ask for back pay?,"So, in a one-on-one meeting with my organization’s executive director a few months ago, I expressed my frustration that I hadn’t been given a chance to negotiate my pay at my first annual review. My workplace has been constantly understaffed in the two years I’ve been employed there, and I’ve not only stayed on, but kept up with a massive workload. This was a part of a larger getting-to-know-you conversation, and we haven’t spoken about it since. 

Today, out of the blue, she called me into her office to inform me that she had looked at the salaries, and that I was being underpaid for my work. She gave me a letter informing me that I would be getting a raise effective next pay period in the amount of an additional $3,000 annually. 

I’ve worked for this organization for almost two years, so that amounts to ~$5,000 that I’ve been underpaid over that time. How do I go about asking for that in backpay? I was too surprised at the impromptu 3 minute-long meeting today to initiate this conversation at the time. Any advice?",1
t3_bzbvad,Credit is 515. I don't even qualify for a secured credit card. Advice?,"Hello, I have a pretty bad credit score due to two credit cards that I maxed out and couldn't afford to pay off the card so they were closed. I understand that it was my fault that I'm in the position I am now.

After coming home from 6 months of travel work I come to find out she was having an affair. (Advice: Being young + large amount of time spent from your significant other = disaster)

I then spent the next month living off my savings and cash advances to buy a large cargo van for my stuff and getting out as soon as I can. At the time I wasn't thinking about the terrible financial decisions I was making, but doing everything I can to leave.

The representative in the billing department told me that the medical provider billing department has gotten a lot of these calls recently and it turns out that one of the debt collection agencies they use put a new system in place that has resulted in many debt collection letters for services provided in 2012, 2013, and 2014 going out.

t3_bz8vnk,Fair quote for cost of major dental work?,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is one of those people who takes care of everyone without worrying about herself. She came from a lower-middle class family without dental insurance. Over time her teeth got worse &amp; worse to the point she didn't want to go to the dentist because she was afraid of the cost of getting the help she needs, even with insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Well I finally convinced her to go. The insurance she has covers an annual maximum of $1500. The dental work she needs is around $11,000 after insurance. It's going to be 3 separate procedures. Not sure what exactly will be done but it sounded like extracting multiple teeth that are causing severe pain and implanting new ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if $11,000 sounds reasonable for these kinds of dental procedures. She wont let me or my siblings pay a dime even though we can easily cover it in full. It's beyond fucking frustrating because she's sacrificed so much for us but she wont accept anything from us because she ""doesn't want to treat her kids like a bank."" I just want to make sure she's paying a fair price...",1
t3_bza3q4,"My score is 480, is there any hope for me?","I had a discover card, and thought I had paid it off but it added up to 800$ in dept then sold to collections agency, I paid them on time for almost a year then when I finally paid them off I called up and closed my account, but somehow it didn’t close and now I owe 800$, I tried calling discover, and everything, but now its in a collection agency.

Is there anyway for me to get back to 600s? I just checked my credit report and it says 2 delinquent charges on it, no idea what they are, about to find out. What should i do?


EDIT// I took the first few steps to fixing my credit thanks to you guys. I just checked everything like you guys said, and ordered a secured card. Here’s a bit more questions:


I just applied and have a secured 200$ card coming to me. I have a question about using it.

So can I use all the 200$ In a week, refill the 200$, then by the end of the month, just use 20$ before the statement comes,and it’ll show 10% ultilization right? Aka, can I use all the money on the card as much as I want, as long as I put enough money to get it up to 180$ before the statement date? For the 10$ use, then pay it off by due date.
Is my goal to only get 10% usage on it per statement, then pay off that 10% by the “due date” ?

I have 4 delinquent charges ruining my credit

1: discover card, (paid on time for 2 years, then 3 years of C/O after missing 3 to 4 payments. (Means charged off)

2: a hospital visit, never paid, in collections

3: another hospital, in collections

4: a payment plan for an online item (bought a  1000$ item, with 250$ payment, paid next month, then didn’t pay rest) in collections

So I have,
Discover Fiancial, still filing C/O every month for 800$
And 3 collection agency’s that add up to about 2000$

Is there anyway to get discover to remove all the C/O’s?, and is there a way to get the collection agency’s to remove them if I offer to pay them off?",1
t3_bzb4kc,I feel upfront cost of buying is the biggest barrier to saving money. How do people do it?,"I'm in my late 20's and am one of those people who has their stuff together (no debt, good career) and know where I'd like to stay for the foreseeable future. My SR is 50% but I'm losing out on building equity by renting. But the upfront cost prevents me from immediately buying in the first place (I can certainly afford the mortgage with ease) and I'm effectively dumping money down the drain by renting. 

I live in a city with relatively low cost of living - rent with bills for a 1 bedroom apartment is 30% of my takehome - and my savings rate is 50% living a modest lifestyle. Even though property is relatively affordable for a city this size, the upfront cost to buy a 2 bedroom place (downpayment, duties, etc) requires saving up for 7 years. That means wasting money on rent during the same time period, that would have paid for 20% of the property's value.

I've done the calculations for another city that I'd consider living in (it's more expensive overall, but also pays better and has more career doors) and assuming there's also rent that needs to be paid, the upfront cost for buying also requires saving up for 10-ish years.

Since the upfront cost is basically an amount not covered by a home loan, I will be 30-35 before I can even think about buying, not counting price inflation and I've already had a head-start of sorts being debt-free since graduation.

The only options I see are to partner up and get married (halving rent, reducing income tax and increasing combined income), live with parents/relatives if they're willing and/or get a family/friend loan on the upfront cost. Are these really my only options to speed up the route to stop wasting money on rent and building equity?",1
t3_bz3yar,"59 year old mother is struggling financially, how can I help her get out of debt and learn how to budget?","I am an early 20s college grad living in the Midwest. My mom has never been the best at handling her finances (I’m fairly certain she’s been in significant, worsening debt to every type of lending agency under the sun for as long as I’ve been alive). I discovered she had around ~$10,000 in debt/collections right before I began college four years ago. About two years ago, my grandfather/her father passed away and she inherited a decent amount of money and investments from him, but I was never really told how much. But it was enough for her to 1) pay for a new SUV in cash, 2) eat out/have food delivered nearly every night, and 3) move into/pay the deposit on a more expensive apartment than the one she had lived in previously. I don’t think she put any of it towards paying off her debt. To her credit, she is very generous and helped me out when I was having issues with my school funding and stipend disbursement, which of course I’m extremely grateful for.

Her spending habits have pretty much remained the same for the past two years, up until February/March of this year. She came to me asking if I could borrow $2000 from a small fund my grandparents (my father’s parents; my mom and dad divorced years ago) have invested intended for each of their grandchildren’s education, or in my case if I decide to go on and get a masters; apparently she had taken out multiple payday loans and title loans on her car. I obviously didn’t feel comfortable with this, as I’d have to lie about the reason I was withdrawing the money from the account to my grandparents, so I told her that was something I couldn’t do. Instead, I gave her as much as I could out of my own savings (literally all of it since I didn’t have a full-time job as a student, about $1000) so she could pay her rent and eat. I also had her ask HR to start depositing her paycheck onto a special debit card, since the payday lenders automatically take essentially her entire paycheck from the account her paycheck used to be deposited in.

About every week since then, she has been requesting money for food/gas/etc. Small amounts around $20-$40. This doesn’t sound like much, but I’m in the process of securing a full-time job now that I have a degree and have had barely enough hours at my current student job to pay my own bills. I’m behind on basically everything at this point, my credit score has dropped, and I’ve been stressed beyond belief. I want to help her in a way that might actually fix her situation long-term. From what I understand, her options are:

A) Credit consolidation service - a few months ago I researched local credit counseling services and found a highly rated organization that was close to where she lives. She went to an appointment there but was told she’s about $450 short in monthly income to afford their services. I expect to be employed full time in the next month or so, so I could probably fill in the gap and help her afford this. I absolutely want to help her, but 450+ per month from me would still be a pretty significant chunk of my expected paycheck (I didn’t get a very technical degree, unfortunately).

B) Bankruptcy - she really doesn’t have any assets, so aside from the upfront cost (around $2000, from what I’ve read) I feel like this might be her best option. Again, she has a ton of outstanding debt and a crappy credit score to begin with, so I don’t think the consequences of filing would worsen her situation any.

Unfortunately she seems to think that having her paycheck deposited on a card her lenders can’t touch and having me fill in the gaps is a solution, even though I try to explain that it’s not. Not because I’m selfish - I love my mom and truly want to help - but eventually, her car will be repossessed and neither of us could afford to replace it. I have a feeling this will continue to be a problem for the rest of her life, and I don’t want our relationship to be based solely on my ability to support her (this is how her and my grandfather’s relationship was when he was alive, and it was toxic).

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.",1

t3_bz5p1y,Is US Physical Therapy this expensive throughout the US?,"During March 2019, I had a bum knee and tried among other physical therapy. I
had a 45 minute evaluation and 2 45 minute pt sessions. The staff was already
to book me for twice/week for the next months. I asked how much my portion
would be be AFTER insurance and they were thinking somewhere between $100 and $200.

I tried calling their billing office and was on hold now less than 20 minutes for each of three calls.

So, I waited and got back to my elliptical at home.

In the first week of May, I got theses expenses

PHYSICAL THERAPY - GENERAL CLASSIFICATION   1,740.44             

PT EVALUATION MOD COMPLEX     - 73410000101 468.00
PT MANUAL THERAPY 15 MIN      - 73410000028 165.38

PT THERAPEUTIC EXER 15 MIN x3 - 73410000021 553.53

This works out to more than $773/hour ... This is not open heart surgery or brain surgery but ""rubber bands, rubber balls and
some stairs""

I confirmed with the hospital these are the correct fees and this is what the market is charging.

My insurance agreed this was gouging and only paid $700 leaving me with $1000 to pay.

I went with a medical billing advocacy company named CoPatient. The hospital again did not pick up initially and finally picked up for CoPatient. When they finally got somebody who could give an answer, they said they cant negotiate because insurance had already paid. 

I found insurance paid before I got the hospital bill.

This smells like a rat. Everybody's hand are in each other's  pockets.

But it doesn't stop there. When questioning various people in the billing dept, and quite frankly anybody who would listen, the first comment is ""Insurance pays for that, right?"" ... $773/hour for physical therapy? ... I even had one of their billing reps say my insurance was not that good as they should have paid for more?

Where does this stop? The can keep doubling their bills, insurance pays the old amount but increases their premiums and we end having to pay a bigger and bigger difference each year. The laws are so tight now that these ""hospitals"" will go right to collections and then you can kiss your premium credit score goodbye.

Anybody run into this before?

What can I do? I feel like I am being mugged? Lucky for me it was only 3 visits. What would happened if I did 2 months? Worse, what if it was really serious and I could not walk or was otherwise immobile.

t3_bzc02j,Waiting to hear back on raise....and wanting to leave company,"Hi everyone,

Apologies if this isn’t the right sub, but looking for some advice on my current situation.

Long story short, three and a half weeks ago I asked for a 15% raise and my boss said he needed to talk to people (HR, Communications Director that I now work under, etc.) and he’d get back to me. It looks like we are finally meeting this week and I can’t tell if they’ve been dragging their feet or our organization just works slow like this.

Anyway, I now find myself with my mind pretty much made up that I want to leave. I do social media and so it’s a dead end career wise at this place, I know I could be making a good amount of money more elsewhere (took this job after getting laid off and being unemployed for four months), and I’ve had a good amount of creative differences with people at work. I want to leave, but am still waiting to hear back on the raise. 

So, my question to all you is: Aside from just hoping they don’t give me the full amount I asked for, what’s my path here? It would be a really dick move if they offered me the full amount and I accepted, only to turn around and apply for other jobs immediately. It would also be telling everyone I’m leaving and make it very awkward if they got back to me and I *turned down* the raise. What can I do here now that my mind is up on leaving but I’m still waiting to hear back on a raise I requested three and a half weeks ago?",1
t3_bza20x,Need help with rental property calculations,"Ok, so I am trying to work backwards and figure out what kind of rental property I need to purchase at some point in the future if I want my take home pay (excluding property management fees, repairs, mortgage, and income taxes) to be $3000. I don’t know if the numbers I’m calculating with are off, so maybe someone could help me.
Online I saw that a rough estimate is that you can expect a property to gross you 1% of its value. This seemed accurate as we have a $220K property that would gross us about $2100 monthly if we rented all the units.
I then used a mortgage calculator, assuming 20% down and a rate of 4.2% to calculate mortgages for some differing price points.
I assumed that property management fees would be 10%, as this is the standard I’ve seen.
I estimated that annual repairs would be 1% of annual value per a recommendation online.
Income tax I usually round to 25%z
That being said, if I bought a $1,000,000 income property for example, grossing $10,000monthly, and losing $1000 to management fees, $2500 to income tax, $4820 to a mortgage, and $833 to repairs, that would leave me with a measly $847 profit each month.

t3_bzbm6q,Freelancer tax issues (IRS says I owe the same amount of money - TWICE?),"I'm a freelance designer in NYC. For the past two years, I've been paying a CPA in LA to file my taxes.

2017 was the first year I filed with him, no problem. I fill out the spreadsheets he gives me and send over my W2s. I got a hefty return and was happy. But shortly after, he contacted me saying that the IRS said I owed a little over $2,300 in taxes for unreported income in 2016. Sure enough, while I had not been full-time freelancing then, there were a few side jobs that I'd neglected to report. So in May of last year I filed an amended return for the year 2016 and added some expenses hoping to offset some of that liability.

Months went by and I hadn't heard anything about the amended return, so I reached out to my accountant to ask. He said not to worry, sometimes these things just take a while and that he would be in touch when he heard anything. 

I let that lie until I filed my 2018 return this year. CPA said I should expect to get $3,200 back from the IRS. Instead, I get $675. I contact him about this. He checks my refund status, and it says: ""your refund has been reduced due to pay a past due IRS tax obligation.""

Now, $3,200 minus $675 is $2,525 - not far off the amount I still owed from 2016. I asked my CPA if this could be the past due balance. (If so, that's fine, I just don't want to keep owing money!) He said he would check with the IRS and get the breakdown.

Then a week later, he emails me separately to say ""the IRS came back with a final adjustment for your 2017 tax return and you owe $2,583 now based on their changes. Do you want to pay that in in full or set up installments?""

I am so confused now. I already paid $2,525 by having it taken out of my tax return. Now it seems like he is saying that I owe close to that number yet again. And I never got a response on my amended 2016 return. I feel like I am not getting the full picture. I've asked for all of my documents from this guy so I can take them to someone else. But I'm curious if any of you Redditors have an idea as to what is going on, or what I should be looking for. I feel overwhelmed and confused by this tax stuff.

Here's the rundown: I am 28 years old, married, own my home (no mortgage), own my car (no loan), have no debt, and work for a government agency (current salary: $100k gross, $2,400 bi-weekly paycheck; lifetime salary cap: $160k gross). My husband generally manages our home/car/dog/life/bill paying etc, and has a part-time job (about $20k a year gross). We live in the DC area and will probably stay, and our post-deduction expenses (taxes, car insurance, cost of driving, groceries, bills, going out, vacations, etc) are something like $50k annually. We get life insurance, health/dental/vision insurance, a health flexible spending account, Thrift Savings Plan (retirement plan, matched up to 5% by employer, I am currently putting in 6%), etc through my job, which bring our net from my job to about $63k a year. We are hoping to have a baby in the next 3 years, and will only be having one. My husband will be the primary caretaker and will most likely stop working. I also have a Roth IRA and we have an index fund with about $20k in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next March, I am getting a 550k inheritance, and we are trying to figure out how to allocate that money. Our main question is whether I should (option 1) take a low net pay and max out my TSP ($19k annually) and to make up for the lowered paycheck by pulling from the 550k, which would be sitting in one/several index funds OR (option 2) to put some money into TSP (like I'm doing now) but primarily use my paycheck for expenses and leave the 700k in one/several index funds to grow untouched. I've run the numbers on both options, and option 1 gets us about 6 million in TSP and option 2 gets us about 8 million over 40 years, but my understanding is that option 1 is much less risky.

Other retirement accounts: Roth IRA (maxed every year), and a pension plan through my job (about $80k annually, once I retire). I can carry my health/dental/vision insurances into retirement.

I was recently offered a grade 13 position in my field at another agency. However, the lack of bonus at the new position would mean take-home wise it's essentially a wash. The upside is that the higher base salary would count towards things like TSP matching. Furthermore, there's the potential that I could then move to another position after attaining that higher grade, maybe even back into my old agency.

Am I looking a gift horse in the mouth here by trying to leave a job I enjoy and not even getting a raise just to get what amounts to a better job title? Unlike the private sector that grade increase is almost certainly going to stick if I stay within the government, so has real value in terms of where I can go in my career in the future.",1
t3_bzasee,My company liquidated my HSA investments...,"In October of 2018 my company was taken over by a new contractor. With that change most of our benefits were transitioned at the beginning of the year. It was all very painless, for example our 401ks were sold and repurchased without any loss of funds. 

However, our HSA through payflex was not transferred until this month. HR sent out a notice saying your assets would transfer to the new companies payflex HSA but you would need to reselect your investment options. When I was able to log in I was surprised to find they had sold all my investments. 

Since my company apparently has full control over my HSA should I continue to invest? I was in a s&amp;p 500 index but now I'm thinking I should be more conservative.  I have a vanguard bond find and conservative and moderate growth funds available.",1
t3_bz48u7,My parents are using my name to purchase their next house - will this hurt my credit score or my chance of getting my own place?,"Hello, I don’t know if this is a good idea considering I’m about to graduate soon (22) and want to have my own apartment.

My parents said it would be hard to get a loan this year from the bank but they could easily get it next year. However, if they do want to get this house and have that loan right now, they would need my name along with theirs???

I just got notified by my bank about a recent inquiry for my credit report so I’m guessing that the house deed or mortgage loan might be under my name. 

They plan to sell the house later on but I’m uncomfortable with this as I have no clue about real estate. 

My question is, will any of this hurt my chance of getting my own place or affect my credit score (750) in a negative manner?",1
t3_byji2n,PLEASE take some time to understand your benefits at work,"I'm a federal employee and you wouldn't believe how often I encounter people who have no idea how any of our benefits work. The most common I see are:

* People find out they (or their federal employee spouse) are pregnant and want to know how much maternity leave we get (answer: NONE)
* They think FMLA is 12 weeks of PAID leave - this is disturbingly common
* Then they want to know how they can get short-term disability after the baby is born (answer: that's not a benefit the government gives you - you would have had to enroll before now)
* They want to know how the leave bank works (many agencies have this) and are shocked when they find out they would have had to already be contributing to it in order to draw from it
* They have no idea how our retirement savings (TSP) work - have either not been contributing since they started employment, or are contributing a little but have never adjusted the allocation beyond the government bond fund that all new enrollees are in

Most people are pretty good at researching all the ins and outs of health insurance, but beyond that they make a lot of assumptions about our benefits and never bother to dig into the details. This leaves you woefully unprepared for an event like a medical emergency or pregnancy.",1

t3_bz4ji3,"Newly married, need mortgage and home owner advice","Hello PF,

I'm newly married and currently living in Maine. I'm 31 and my wife is 32. Before we got engaged she moved to Maine for a great job opportunity and I soon followed. Before I joined her, she purchased a condo by herself. I am not on the loan or anything, but we did split the mortgage from day one. 

Now that our finances are completely combined, is it a good idea for us to add myself to the loan and property info or does being married automatically attach me legally? We plan on purchasing a house in the near future (either in Maine or Massachusetts) and was wondering if I would be eligible for 'first time home buyers' programs. Does being married to a homeowner affect that? If I am added to the loan, will that disqualify me from eligible programs?

t3_bzak81,"[UK] Can, or should, I create an LLC as a means to invest?","I am 20, and doing my best to learn about different investment strategies - long-term, for the most part.  My question is simple. I know LLCs in the UK require a director to be appointed, and there to be one shareholder. Can that one shareholder be the director? If so, are there any other complications that would mean that I couldn't be the sole owner of an LLC and use its capital to invest how I would personally, but being subject to different (I don't know if they would even be better) tax methods?

Secondly, would it make much of a difference? The only benefits I can think of are that (1) I would pay less tax on my investments (would I?), and (2) I would just rather invest through something like an LLC, and keep it separate from my personal accounts, for the sake of keeping it organised.

t3_bzaird,Should I look into opening a new credit card to help credit age average in the future? (Young account),"Hi! Some possibly helpful background: 

I’m a soon to be college grad with 2 credit cards: 1. BoA Cash Rewards, Almost 4 years old 2. Target card, 1 year old. 

I‘ve used my BoA card in lieu of a debit card since opening it. (I think I used it so much that my credit limit was increased without request from 1,000 to 4,000 the day before Black Friday a year into opening the account. I spent a lot that Friday.) Anything I buy that’s not at Target, I use this card and pay it off in full each month. I don’t have any debts or student loans. 

I tried opening a Costco Citi card about a year ago and was denied because of a lack of credit history or low score (though my FICO score has averaged 750, though has fluctuated from 780-740 every now and then—I assume the high score is result of the thin file effect? Or something like that?). Today I finally made a credit karma account and saw that the average of my credit age is low because of the two cards I have. 

So to the actual question at hand, should I look into opening a new credit card now to lower average today but let it all age together or just open another card further down the line and take a hit to the average in the future? Or should I just stick with what works and keep my card count at 2? If it’s recommended I open a new card, what card do you suggest? And even then, how do y’all recommend balancing the use of multiple cards? 

Sorry for all the questions, novice understanding on my behalf, and the oversharing. I appreciate any and all insight and knowledge!",1
t3_bzai0q,Truck That Was Offered vs Buying a New Car,"So I'm going to start driving soon, and my grandpa has kept a 2007 Silverado for me since I was in high school (22 now), he took it back from his son which is how he got it. He drove it for awhile, put it in storage and told me that when I was ready to drive it's mine. 

Now that I'm finally learning how to drive,  he's giving me a choice between the truck and 3k to put towards a new vehicle, and he would drive the truck if I take the money. He's run his vehicle into the ground, and it needs repairs, hence why he'd be driving the Silverado instead, at least until it gets fixed.

I'm leaning towards taking the money, the truck has a little over 110k on it, a few minor things wrong with, but as far as I can tell runs just fine, and he needs to be able to safely get around anyways, my question is whether or not I'm screwing myself in the long run. I never planned to buy a new car for my first vehicle, always used so it isn't like I haven't thought about it, but I don't want to end up on the losing side of this if I can help it. He's said that I can still use it if I need to get work, or if I go out and he doesn't need it etc., so it isn't like I'm necessarily out of a vehicle, at least temporarily, but I'm still stuck thinking it over.

t3_bz8pxr,New to HSA - What if expenses exceed contribution limit?,"Hi, sorry if this is a dumb question but would appreciate any help. I just got off my parents' insurance this year and was recently hospitalized and diagnosed with a life-long condition. I'm finally getting around to taking a look at the bills and working through payments, etc.    

Based on my monthly contributions and employer match, I'm on track to reach the $3500 individual contribution limit this year. My questions are:        

   

1. What if my expenses/payments deplete the fund? I can't make any additional tax-deductible contributions right?     
2. Is there a way for me to set up post-tax contributions once I reach the limit? Or is my only option to set up a separate account that pulls a certain amount from my checking each payday?

 

To be honest, I don't have much in savings at the moment because I prioritized paying off student loans and was naive enough to think I wouldn't need a significant rainy day fund any time soon. I pretty much forgot I had a balance in the HSA (out of sight, out of mind, right?) but once I saw this bill, I was DEFINITELY glad to have it because idk how else I would have paid for these initial expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a high deductible plan and fully anticipate that my upcoming treatments/appointments this year will result in my total out of pocket medical expenses far exceeding the $3500 limit. 

&amp;#x200B;

To address the lack of savings, I've cut back on my expenses as much as reasonably possible, and am scheduled to start bar backing a few nights a week (once I recover a bit more) to supplement my full-time income.

t3_bza7fw,In need of a financial overhaul,"So I have multiple issues keeping me from getting my finances under control but I will try to keep the focus on what I CAN potential change. 

#1 I am currently making 26k a year and supporting myself and one other person on that income (no assistance).

#2 I have 1400 out of 6000 limit in credit card debt right now. And 330 in loan debt. I mostly have the loan under control as it will be completely paid off in 3 months. 

The problem. I can only make small payments on the credit card in terms of it’s size. Think: max 150 dollar payments a month. I tried to take another loan out through my bank and was denied today. Reason listed was my credit card had too much on it. 

Backstory: I have very few “luxury” expenses. I used to eat out about twice a week but have since taken that away. Also used to enjoy some alcohol a few times a week, removed that due to financial constraints. Currently have a game membership costing around 30 dollars a month that I’m contemplating cancelling as well.

t3_bza1e6,Life Insurance if you're older and not well?,"I'm 58 and my health isn't great, I have a few chronic conditions.I have no assets or life insurance anymore and I'm wondering if there's any way I can get some insurance, just so the kids have something if the treatment I'm going through doesn't help and I die within a decade.20 years ago I went thru an ugly divorce with a man who had a secret abusive side. He made my life very difficult even after I left him—stalking, harassing, turning friends and family against me. He's very convincing and some of them are way bigger arseholes than I could ever have imagined before we hit hard times.We had 2 kids. I bought a house for us when I left my husband, put 100k into it and the mortagage was manageable with me working part-time. We should have been okay except that my youngest got bone cancer. The treatment was very long and drawn out, even after 10 years we were still having operations. I spent a very long time in hospital with him, sleeping on a fold-out chair—I had to give up work and I lost my house and my own health suffered. My family wouldn't help; I don't see them anymore. My child lived, thank god.

Re my house: my father and his wife put in 1/5, and my husband put in another 1/5. I had 3/5. I fell way behind on mortgage payments when my son was diagnosed and I had no income, and they basically arranged amongst themselves to sell it to my father's wife for less than we paid for it. I was devastated but way too caught up with a dying child to do much. I really never thought they would leave us homeless and with no assets, but they did. My father has since died, leaving us nothing, and his wife still owns my house. She is a lawyer and a real estate investor, has several properties but she likes to cry poor. She won't help. This was 10 years ago now so I doubt I have a legal recourse, anyway, she's a very good lawyer, lol. Nothing comes between that one and a buck.

But now I have a good flat with a decent rent that hopefully will be long-term. My only income is from occasional writing and a welfare pension but we can live comfortably on that. If I get a bit better I could make more from writing—probably.

My eldest (22) has just started a full-time, decently paid job and is living with us for now—he came home from a different city where he was at uni, he's cut back uni to part time. He'll probably want to move out in a few months but wants to save some money. He's good with budgeting, but I do need him to contribute to the bills now he's earning. I still want him to be able to save, though.  


I had a good career, but these circumstances cut into it, and it's not possible for me to return, I'm too far out of the loop with the technology and not well enough to work. I do some writing on my good days and get paid for political articles sometimes.  


The younger one (20) has just finished with his operations and is now looking at uni, has occasional casual work, and wants to stay living with me. He's an artist and doesn't want a career outside or that, though my oldest is more ambitious. I am going to try to get the youngest on the lease so if anything happens to me the flat lease goes to him: it's a really valuable thing to have as my city is unbelievably expensive, and we were basically homeless for 2 years while he was still being treated. I hope and believe the tenancy can be very long-term.

Their father has some money; he's about to retire and sell his city home which is worth about 2-3 million. I've suggested to the boys that they ask him to give them their inheritance from that so they can put it into property now. We've talked about buying a house in the country not too far from the city, to ensure we always have a home. Our days without a home have made us very conscious and fearful of that situation. I would move to the country if the boys did that.

They see the sense in the idea, but they're not very comfortable with asking him. He has a lovely adult daughter from another relationship, and his current wife has an adult son, so that's 4 kids with a claim to an inheritance.

I just want to be able to let the boys have something when I die. Life insurance is the only thing I can think of, but I worry that my health will make it way too expensive, or even impossible.  
We live in Australia, btw.

t3_bz0oo2,Should we refinance our mortgage if we bought one year ago? (US),"Hi!

Our mortgage broker is pressuring us to refinance. I'm not sure if it's a great idea. 

We bought in April of 2018. We paid 375,000 for a 2 bed/2.5 bath townhouse with a 1 car garage. We're in Northern CA. 

We put 5% down with a 4.625% interest rate. Our Payment is $2659.58 including our HOA

&amp;#x200B;

Our broker gave us an analysis to refinance at 3.875% interest.  This would bring our payment down to $2381.34 including our HOA. So a savings of $278 per month. Half of this savings comes from a lower PMI. We don't have the money for the closing costs, he is saying we could roll the closing costs into the loan if we get a high enough appraisal.. 

Our property may or may not have gone up in value. (A similar home in our complex without a garage just sat on the market for 6+ months and finally sold for $335,000) 

My husband was not expecting to refinance so soon and has a problem with spending.  He just took out a $18,000 loan to pay off his credit cards.  We keep separate finances and each pay half of our bills, so I had no idea he had racked up so much debt. I assumed he was paying for things with the overtime he was working. (I'm going to be taking over his finances from now on to try to help him get this under control).

Our debt to income ratio is not great. He has a $400 loan payment, a $300 car payment. I just have a $150 car payment. We made $110K last year combined. I'm not sure we would qualify for a lower rate at this point. 

We just had a baby 5 months ago and this seems very overwhelming. 

I'm not sure if this is enough info but do you have any advice?

Edit: he let us know closing would be less than 4k! We would pay $600 for the appraisal and the rest would be financed. If the estimated savings is accurate we would recoup the closing costs in a little over a year. We plan on keeping this home as a rental of we ever decide to move",1

t3_bz9q06,Does buying a new car make more financial sense for me?,"I did some rough estimations, and it seems like buying a new car is a better value. Here's the situation, I received a Subaru as a gift with low mileage. Based on KBB, the car is worth about $14-15k. Let's just say 15k. The car is a 2014 model, and I will need to put some money into maintenance over the 3 years. I estimate about $2k. I know I will for sure have to replace the tires and brake pads, and potentially rotors, and that alone will cost me about 1k already. I will also need to buy a new battery soon, etc. The car will also depreciate. I estimate by the end of 3 years, the car will further depreciate another 4k. So assuming I sell the car for 11k, I end up with 8000 dollars. (11,000 - 2000 maintenance). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now if I were to buy a new car, I could trade in my Subaru and get a 2019 Honda. I've already spoken with some dealerships, and one offered to take my car, and I would only need to pay $6.5k out the door in addition to the trade in. Because the car is brand new, I won't need to replace tires, and brake pads, just basic maintenance like oil changes which won't cost much. Assuming I sell this car in 3 years, I estimate the car will depreciate down to about $15k. So 15k-6.5k = 8500. 

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to keeping the old car, I am up 500 bucks. I know by estimations are rough, but even if I end up 1000 less with the new car, I think it's worth it because I am getting a brand new car with warranty, I don't have to worry about the engine breaking, I get much more safety features such as a back up camera, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I need a car for at least the next 3 years of my life because I will be moving out to California for a job. After those 3 years, I don't know where I will be, so let's just assume I will sell the car in 3 years.

Has anyone come across any books / services / tools that have helped you help your parents with retirement? My parents are  approaching retirement age and I don't believe they have enough saved to live comfortably. I'd like to start planning but I have no idea how to incorporate social security, medicare, elder care, etc. into my cost assumptions. 

&amp;#x200B;

My main questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What type of public benefits will be available as they age (e.g. SS, medicare.medicaid, etc.) and where can I get info on specifics?
2. What costs will not be covered by public benefits? (e.g. elder care??)
3. What are some creative ideas for helping them generate income? (For example, we're thinking of buying a multi-unit property where rent can be used to subsidize their income once we pay off mortgage. Has anyone else done this?)

&amp;#x200B;

**BACKGROUND (in case helpful...)**

***Me***

34 yrs / Married / Considering starting a family

Combined Income: $280k (likely $300k next year)  

Combined Assets: $530K (across brokerage / 401K / IRAs)

Debt: No debt (but considering buying a house in next 1-2 yrs)

Living Costs: Very low, we easily live within our means. If we get a mortgage, cost would be the same or less than rent.

&amp;#x200B;

***Parents:***

64 &amp; 63 

Combined Income: $20K.  (Normally around $110K but my Dad hasn't been able to work over the last year so they are relying on my Mom's  salary.)

Costs: They live in a high cost area but are pretty frugal

Combined Savings: $750,000 (All 401K)

Other Assets: I believe their home is worth $450K and they share a car

Debt: I don't know but I think it's  sizable. Maybe $80K mortgage, $90K for sister's school loans, they recently took out a 2nd mortgage on their home for reasons I don't understand, etc.

Health Care: Mom plans to work until my Dad is 64.5 so that they have health insurance. At that point, they can access Medicare.

Note:  My Mom has been struggling with significant health issues and my Dad has essentially stopped working as a consultant. I worry that they're vulnerable to poor financial choices. Assuming no catastrophes, I think my parents will have enough to meet their basic needs once SS kicks in. 

 I want them to (1) have a fun retirement and (2) not be worried about financial safety. Assuming that a ""comfortable retirement"" is $70K and that they will  draw $2K in SS and 3% off their 401K, then we're looking at a **$23K/ year shortfall** between what they will earn (without reducing 401K principal) and what they would need.

Lease: down payment, monthly payment, assuming you stay in the mileage limitations. So you know your cost for the lease term. The lease states what the buyout amount will be at the end of the term (can that change). 

Buying: calculate over all cost of loan. 

Is that all of the factors to calculate total cost of lease vs loan?",1

- I have an automatic (post-tax) transfer to an online savings account. The interest rate isn’t great but it’s the best I could find for a low dollar amount
-automatic investment in my ROTH IRA. I work for a teeny company with zero benefits (not even health insurance) so all retirement savings is on me. 

Other useful information:
- I live in a VERY expensive Southern CA city. My rent is below market for the area, it’s a 1-bedroom, I live by myself. I’m not sure moving is practical - I’m not sure I’ll find anything cheaper, even a roommate situation.

She relayed to me that instead of finally moving in together by renting an apartment or condo, her parents want to contribute to a downpayment to a condo/townhouse. This seems great on the surface but I’m hesitant and don’t know how to take it.

t3_bz5og9,Please help me figure out how to get out of this terrible financial situation me and my family are in.,"*TLDR/Recap below*
I’m 19 (last born) and I live with my Dad (52), my mom(47), and my oldest sister (27). I just graduated and am already “technically” hired at my local Dollar General store (I am setup to do their online training starting Wednesday morning then have my first shift Friday morning.) It’s also the best option for a job in my small town. I have no credit history at the moment, my mom and dad’s is at least somewhere around Poor or worse. We have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee with 250K miles on it that works well enough to work currently but has started having some problems. We rent a place for $700 a month and the landlords are luckily the more lenient and understanding type (and were not moving for the foreseeable future btw), currently the place works good enough for us and our 6 huskies.
Here’s where the problems start: my dad has worked basically all his life about 30-35 years straight, but he just got a knee replacement and is scheduled for the other knee replacement for a few months from now so he won’t be going back to work for at the very least 6-9 months, he really needs them but of course it cuts big time into our income for now. He can’t get unemployment because PA has the dumbest rules about it I’ve ever heard. He can’t work and should be eligible but isn’t because apparently they expect him to work on one leg (yes I’m still pissed about it). Anyway, my Mom can’t work at all because she is permanently injured/disabled  from a car accident and she can’t file for Disability because she still lives with us and they will automatically disqualify her because my sister and Dad (when he was working) had an income and she needs some help with everyday stuff so she stays with us. My sister just works, that’s about it with her.

So here’s a TLDR/recap:
(We get about $450 a month in Food Stamps)
My Mom- can’t work since she is permanently injured/disabled.
My Sister- makes $10.30 an hour working an average of 4-5 days a week doing a 12 hour shift as a gate-guard for a gas company.
My Dad- is out of work temporarily for at least another 6-9 months due to a knee replacement he just had done last month and the other one he’ll have done in a few months. Can’t get unemployment. (He used to make over $10 an hour and usually got 5 days a week working at the same company as my sister does when he was working.) 
Me-I will be making $7.50 an hour Part Time (for now) as a sales associate at my local Dollar General, likely start my first shift Friday morning.

Our budget/debt:
-Gas per week (Appts and work): About $100
-ISP bill: $175 current bill
-Electric: $900 past due
-Gas: $400 past due/current bill:$115
-DirecTV: $275 total/$99 suspension 6/14
-Geico: $51 per month
-Storage: $53 per month
-Rent: $200 left to pay for May + $700 due for June at the end of the month.
-Cell Phones: currently shut off and account sent to collections.
[Had to let some bills go/pile up like our cell phones, Electric, and Gas a little bit.]
-NO Credit Card debt.
At this moment we have the bare essentials food wise; a few loaves of bread, a pack of bologna and ham, eggs, 1 box of cereal, milk, coffee, and water. Luckily we get stamps on Wednesday. Regardless, I am tired of living literally paycheck to paycheck. It has gotten gradually worse over the past year or so. The most depressing thing is walking out and seeing my dad just holding his head in his hands feeling helpless. I am depressed, my sister has been diagnosed too. The best I could get job wise is working Part Time (for now, no timetable yet for when I’ll be full time) for $7.50 an hour working right around 20 hours a week and I feel like it still won’t be enough. I just don’t really know what else to do at this point. I wanted to try to do monthly payments on a pre owned/used car in really good shape through a friend who works at a dealership but the cheapest car I could get is $150-$175 a month and IF I work exactly 20hrs a week then I make exactly $150 but that’s before any taxes or anything like that so I don’t think I could even do that right now and would have to wait until my manager says I can work full time.

t3_bz6yn7,Will getting a cosignature from someone of equal credit standing help lower rates of an auto loan?,"I’m looking to replace my car - I’ll be putting down $5,000 and financing the remaining $16,000. 

My credit is good, 755-765 from FICO and Experian, but I only have about 5 years of credit history, and all of it is just two/three credit cards and a small auto loan of about $7,000 that is paid off. 

My fiancé has a similar credit rating and similar credit card history, but no auto loan. Neither of us have ever missed a payment and utilization is around 10-15% each. 

If he co-signs/co-borrows(?) for the loan, will that do anything for lowering the rates? If not are there any other positives like will it help us in the future if we both have an auto loan on our credit report when we go to buy a house, or anything like that? 

He’s already agreed to co-sign and he knows what that means and that he’d be responsible for the loan if I died or just said fuck it and made him pay and there’s no issue there, were just wondering if there’s any benefit.

Also if there is a distinction between co signing and co borrowing that would be important for this situation that would be great to know, thanks!",1

My mother (47) currently lives at her boyfriends apartment after being evicted from her own apartment and then her trailer. My adopted brother (18), my blood brother (20) and myself (21) are living with my father in the family home. My mom recently started working at an insurance company and I don't know when she will start receiving a steady paycheck. My adopted brother doesn't work and my blood brother works very little. I work full time and am in college making about $25,000 annually. My dad is going to kick my adopted brother out next week and he has nowhere to go as he doesn't have any friends and none of our extended family members are willing to take him in. My other brother is probably going to be kicked out soon after, and my mom's boyfriend is a psycho who has physically abused her in the past and I believe he will end up giving her the boot as well. There is a trailer park near me that is giving away free run down trailers on the premise that you fix up the place and pay the lot fee ($500 monthly) I have the know how and experience to do that but I would have to be the one to purchase it as my mom has terrible credit and my brothers have none. My score is excellent, but its only a few years of credit card history, so that might not even be a feasible option. We could all squeeze into an apartment, but I don't know how to force everyone to work full time to actually make all this work.

t3_bz8o3z,Negotiating extension on lease; offbeat proposal from landlord,"This is a bit of an odd situation; hoping for your thoughts. I’m moving states soon and my current lease ends on a date when I will be in a completely different location for a nonnegotiable event. My choices are to move out a week ahead of the event or a week later, and I greatly prefer the latter option. 

I asked my landlord for an extension on my current lease, assuming they would want me to pay some kind of premium. Instead, they asked me to find a new tenant to take on a new lease with them.

Does this sound weird to anyone else? I understand putting that burden on a tenant who is trying to break a lease, but I’ve never heard of a landlord asking a tenant to find someone to enter into a whole new lease with them. I told them I needed to think about it, so the specifics are still up in the air. 

The way they made it sound, their concern is that it gets more difficult to find tenants as summer ends. But if that’s the case, why would I be any better at it? Why even entertain my request at all? I mean, if I did manage to find a new tenant, then that person would be on a yearlong lease right after me, so they would have the same problem with the timing a year from now. I’m thinking that the real reason they made this proposal is because they’re having difficulties finding tenants on their own. There are a number of vacant apartments right now, and they’re doing showings all the time. Maybe they’re just angling to outsource their own work. 

Any ideas about how I should respond? I should note that the landlord told me that this proposal was just to “start the conversation,” but I have no idea what sort of counteroffer would satisfy them. Should I just offer to pay an increased rate and see if they take it?",1

t3_bz8n6d,Services and procedures showing as fully paid with deductible not met?,"Ok, this might be a little bit long but I want to cover all the details. I had an HSA account and a HDHP with $5k deductible, $6500k max. I was finally able to keep a years worth of money in the HSA so I can meet the maximums. My wife ended up having a procedure (colonoscopy) and then needed an MRI and other testing. The doctor gave us the number to setup the appointments and we asked about the cash price and with our insurance. Well the office told us prices and we called the insurance and they said since our deductible hasn’t been met if she goes within 10 days and not pre-register we are entirely responsible. Well her doctor decided this needed to happen within 24-48 hours and it cannot wait. They said they are going to call the insurance right away. A few minutes later we get a call from the insurance that said, you are approved and can go any time within the next 30 days. So fast forward we have the appointments, I intend on getting a large bill but will pay with my HSA (as planned) but now all the bills are coming in and it shows the cost, the discount and what the insurance paid and it shows me at zero balance due and they paid it in full. As much as I’m happy to see that I’m also falling inti the mindset of “too good to be true” So to get my mind as ease I call the insurance directly and have the EoB available and they cannot explain why it’s zero. All I’m told is that it was paid in full. 

I should note in the past the online records have said different things in the past, it originally said I owed nothing then log on days later and it has an updated balance of what I owe. The difference this time is I have a physical print out.

My assumptions (total guess) is when the doctor called the insurance they coded it different? Maybe as preventative or something? Our plan offers preventative care and routine check ups at no cost, so maybe this qualified?? 

My last question is, if I have these documents that say zero can they charge me later and just say it was an error or something like that?",1

Last year, she had her own health insurance for the first months (including April).  I added her onto my health insurance beginning in April.

However, I received a 1095-C health insurance form from my employer stating I was covered all 12 months.  It doesn't list her name or any other additional persons anywhere on the form.

After that it starts asking about policy and allocation amounts and I don't know what half the terms mean or if they even apply to us at that point.

All I can figure out is there was a mistake somewhere, either my employer should have included her name on my 1095-C form, the IRS thinks she wasn't covered for the remaining 8 months, and/or I don't know why they sent me a premium tax credit form.

If I quit 4 days later, effective immediately, I keep all my money but burn the bridge.  Pushing the start date of my new job is not an option.


My 401K employer match is 100% vested after 3 years. I'm looking at leaving this job and want to make sure I don't accidentally walk away from about $15,000 in my retirement account. My employment anniversary is July 25, 2016 so this year marks three years. I **must** start my new job July 29th, no exception. Asking them for more time is not an option so that leaves me in a conundrum. I would like to give my resignation with standard notice and have my last day be Friday, July 26th. HOWEVER, I don't trust my boss and I also don't know the company policy on resignations. It's entirely possible that he will send me home the day I resign and I would lose my un-vested funds. I'm seriously considering resigning on either the 25th or the 26th to ensure I leave with my full 401k balance. My question is twofold.

1--if I leave with no notice, (I have other references at the company) how can that backfire on me that I may not be thinking about? 


 2--do I wait until the 26th to resign so that I was definitely at work on the 25th or can I do it on the 25th since that should count as my last day of employment?

To be clear: IF I do leave with no notice, I will make sure there are continuity files, emails, and instructions for all of my projects and I will do my utmost to make it as least painful as possible.

t3_bz8gt9,"Saving Third of My (23) Income, NOT investing in anything, please help!","Hi everyone. I just turned 23 and just started working around 8 months ago. I make around $3000 a month after taxes (45k a year before taxes), and save about $1000 a month.

Right now, all of this is just going in a savings account. At this point I have about $8500 in a savings account and $2500 in checkings. I figure the saving account acts as my 3-6 month emergency fund. But the question is, where do I go from here.

I'm assuming I should be putting a lot into retirement accounts now, but also there are some major purchases I want to save for as well, so I want to prioritise.

In my area a house costs around $300k, so I'd like to have $60k saved as a downpayment when I'm in my early thirties. I'm driving a beater car right now that will last another year or two, but will probably spend around $10k on a car at around 25 (should be making ~55k by then).

My bank is USAA and I have access to fidelity mutual funds. I don't think my employer offers 401k matching, but I can open a 401k and assuming I probably should. I expect I will be making at least 75k by the time I am 30 on my career path and that's a conservative estimate. 

How much should go in a 401k (money I won't touch until retirement) vs how much should go in savings to go for my major purchases over the next decade (newer car + house).  Should I put half in 401k fidelity mutual funds that I can't touch, and half in non-retirement mutual funds that I can touch when I am ready to buy a home?

t3_bz8gid,Taxes on stock market capital gains/losses,"Hello. I was wondering if someone can verify if i am correct or not in my understanding. And help with some questions I may have. I did couple readings on investopedia.

Looking at perspective of single and filing single.

1. you can move your capital loss deduction to future years. not locked into using it for the tax year you got your loss from.

2. short term capital gains is taxed at normal tax brackets. long term is much less.

3. you can deduct a max of $3000 on capital loss to your total taxable income. meaning if you had a net realized capital loss of $5000, you can apply $1500 in deductions and move $1500 for future deductions (whether that be next year, or 10 years from now)

4. basic strategy in using capital loss deduction is to move you to a lower tax bracket. example assuming 2019 tax bracket is same for next year. lets say someone had a capital loss of $1400. his W2 income is $40,300. meaning $825 gets taxed at 22%. if he applies $825 of his $1400 capital loss, it brings him down to $39,475, or at the very edge of 12% tax rate. effectively putting him in the 12% tax bracket. and he can move his $575 left of capital loss for future use.

am i correct in my understanding?",1
t3_bz4xh0,Buying a house sooner or later... we hate where we live currently and rather than spend a years worth of rent we’re thinking about buying this summer with a smaller % down payment. Good idea or bad/ impatient?,"Hello all. Me (29m) and my fiancé (27f) hate where we live (philly). We both grew up in this city and despite having plenty of fond memories, were at an age where were done with this city... too much parking, neighbors up your ass, no privacy, cramped spaces, crazy randos all over the neighborhood, etc, etc... we aren’t city people and want to get out ASAP.

I make 135k and own a property I turned into a rental a few years ago. She makes 45k. We are currently renting because we wanted to save up a traditional 20% down payment and our plan was to buy at this time next year... but we are seriously desiring the surrounding suburb counties more and more each day and want to be done with all the bullshit that comes with living in Philly. Our rent is $1,500 a month (full house with backyard) and we currently have 23k saved up... 

I was daydreaming and thought about going to the bank to get pre-approved and then beginning our house hunt this summer with a smaller % downpayment. Our ideal home price is 400k-475k.

We have the following debts remaining
Rental property mortgage: 170k
My student loans: 10k
Her student loans: 17k
Car loan: 9k
Commuter vehicle lease: $250 a month with 1.5 years left on the lease

In the past I viewed 20% as important to get the optimal interest rate, but at the moment with quality of life and unhappiness and a bright career/earning path ahead of me I feel like whatever the consequence of less than 20% would be is worth it compared to the unsatisfactory housing situation  we have now.

Can others weigh in here and give their opinion on if this is a bad idea/ impatient to my detriment or if this is something to keep exploring and could be a good idea?",1

t3_bz8ekj,Best way to pay off various forms of debt after college?,"I just graduated with a degree in engineering and I've accepted an offer for a job where I'll be making around $4500 per month after taxes. I'm married with no kids and live in an area with a relatively low cost of living so I can probably put around $2000 per month into my debt. My current debt and approximate interest rates are as follows:

-

$58,000 in student loans at 6%

$13,000 in credit card debt at 25%

$12,500 in auto loans (2 cars) at 7% and 13%

$6,500 in personal loans at 40%

-
I know its bad, especially the personal loans, but I did what I had to do to get through college. My credit score would be in the upper 700s if not for my credit card debt but is currently in the low 600s.

The best idea I have right now is to take the following steps:

1. Pay off $6-7k in credit card debt to improve credit score
2. Get a personal loan at a lower rate to pay off high interest personal loans
3. Refinance higher interest auto loan or both
4. Open 1-2 new credit cards that offer 0% interest for first 12+ months and use those for buying while paying off other cards
5. Pay off loans starting with highest interest rate

During all this I'll be making the minimum possible payments on my student loans, setting aside a few hundred per month for emergencies, and starting to save up for a house. My first priority though is to improve my credit score so I can move my debt to lower interest accounts.

Is this is a solid plan or can anyone offer ideas for improvement? Would it be worth it to hire a financial adviser?",1
t3_bz66wq,How do I get a delinquent bill that’s not mine removed from my credit?,"It belongs to my dad for a water bill he missed back in 2016 and since we both have the same name they mistakenly put it on my credit. I wasn’t paying for water and still don’t and I was only 16 going on to 17 at the time. 

We called the collection agency and explained everything to them then they said that the only way it can be removed is if my dad pays for it....keep in mind I used my own social security number, my one and only SSN to open my account back in 2017 it’s my own bank account I don’t share it with my father he has his own so there’s no reason for it to be on my credit. 

I told the collector again that I’m not responsible for the bill and I need it removed off my credit and she told me again that my dad needs to pay for it first before they go ahead and do that. 

Why can’t they just put it on my dads credit? This can ruin my chances of joining the service which I’m trying to do and get a house on my own.

t3_bz8cow,Balance Transfer or Loan for my situation,"Hey Personal Finance,



So, prior to my kid being born two years ago, I had a bit of credit card debt.. about $3,500. We were paying it off at a decent rate but just couldn’t get it fully down. 


When my kid was born, my wife stayed home longer than we intended.. and then daycare costs kicked in. Then, my position at work was eliminated due to budgetary constraints, and my new position pays $15,000 less than my previous position. The only good news is my wife and kid are healthy and happy. Financially, it’s felt like one punch after another. Good news is we’ve stabilized our spending.


We are no longer racking up new debt. The credit cards ballooned up to about $18,000 at one point. Over the last few months, we got it down to $14,000. But interest is going to start in a month. 


So here I am, two years into this. I’m on the “cusp” of a promotion which will increase my salary by $45,000. A new position is opening at work and due to my previous position being cut, I’ve been told by superiors I’m next. But I have to wait until April 2020 before anything would officially kick in. In the mean time, I have been heavily interviewing for new positions in other places that would also provide me with this sort of salary bump, but my field is competitive and not very large; this still could take me a year or two to land. 



I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking of doing a balance transfer to US Bank with 20 months no APR and 3% transfer fee or taking out a 14k SoFi loan over four years at 9%. My financial position should change considerably by this time next year, but it’s so hard for me to rely on that and I need some guidance. These people eliminated a position once on me, I haven’t exactly been trusting lately. 


I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts. Thanks for listening.",1
t3_bz0y68,Woman Asking to Take Pictures of Receipts,"Yesterday, while checking out at a grocery store, I saw a woman asking everyone who checked out if they had their receipt, and if she could take a picture of it. She was not a store employee, and seemed a bit erratic. The store employees seemed bothered by her, but not enough to kick her out.

When she asked me if I had a receipt, I lied and said no, then asked why she was asking. She claimed to have an app on her phone that paid her to take pictures of receipts, and claimed she was making $3000 - $5000 a year from doing so. She also claimed this money was going towards buying gifts for her kids birthdays and Christmas gifts.

The whole situation seemed sketchy to me, so I moved along. I went home and did some research, but could not find anyway to make so much money off of taking pictures of other people's receipts. I found some applications that would occasionally pay you for receipt pictures, and other applications like Google Rewards, which will occasionally ask for a receipt after seeing you visit a certain location.

All that said, is this some sort of scam, or is there actually an application out there that will pay you to endlessly take pictures of receipts?

TLDR - Woman was trying to take pictures of people's receipts at the grocery store, claiming to be making thousands of dollars a year from it. Scam, or actual money making strategy?

t3_bz4ijw,Should I refinance? I have very exact details on my situation inside..,"I currently have a 30 year fixed at 4.625% with a payment of $3290, an approx balance of $627,304 and 345 payments left.

My broker has offered to refinance it down to 3.99%, for total cost of \~$1500 that gets rolled into the mortgage.  This will take the payment down to $2991. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said I can then either take the monthly savings of $299, OR, continue to pay the old payment of $3290 which would pay off the home in 303 months vs. the current 345 months. He said if the home is paid off 42 mos early at $3290 = that equals $138,180 in savings.  It seems like my bottom line is to either take the monthly cash flow savings of $299 or pay it off early. He said in either case I would save .635% in rate on $627,304 which is $3983/yr in interest savings.

late 20's, USA, just came into some money for the first time in my life and want to finally fix my terrible credit but I don't know where to start. To my knowledge the only sources of my outstanding debt are:

two courses from a local community college that claims I didn't pay (also in the 2013-14 time frame).

I have received hundreds of calls over the years from collectors which I always ignore out of fear (especially when sometimes the numbers appear as my own number almost down to the digit), but which I'm sure relates to the credit card. I don't know if the community college debt has gone to collection as well, but I assume it has after this length of time. I'm ready to finally face the music and pay whatever outstanding amount I owe to get my credit back on course. But I don't know where to start.

• Jul/Aug onward: Likely to start a new job soon. Salary should be much lower than before due to new career goals, but I have no idea how by much.

I did as much research as I could but most FAQs on self-employment/quarterly taxes assume I'm running a sizable business with a relatively stable income. If I use my 2018 income/taxes as a guide I will wildly overpay. 

As I'll be going through three different employment situations with very different incomes over the course of the year, I'm incredibly confused as to what I'm estimating against.

• For quarterly period Apr 1 - May 31 my self-employment income was $2k. 

• For whole year I expect self-employment income to total no more than $4-5k. All the rest should be from normal full time employment.

I've seen a lot of sites mention that you only pay quarterly if your liability is going to be over $1k. But $1k of what? Specifically vis a vis self-employment income? I of course won't owe $1k on $2k, tho maybe I might on 5k?

The balance of the card is $2000, and they are threatening to sue me. I obtained this card while living in Puerto Rico, but in 2015 I moved to the state of Georgia (I’m a student), in May 2016 I received a call indicating that the account had gone to a collection agency, at that time I said  that I did not recognized the account and they never called me again.
My question is: the statute of limitations in Puerto Rico is 3 years and this account has just turned 3 years old on May 23, 2019 from the day the account was opened with the collection agency. (It's been more than 3 years since the day I stopped paying)

-The lawyers that are trying to contact me can sue me in the state of Georgia using the statute of limitation of Georgia that is 6 years?

 -The statute of limitations that is in force is the one of the state where I opened the credit card which is Puerto Rico or does it change when the new collection agency took control of the account in 2016?",1
t3_bz7iev,"Is a high interest savings account still the best way to ""invest"" liquid money?","Hello everyone, I am going to my last year of college this next year. I have around $17,000 in my savings/checking (summer internship paid me one lump sum of about $7500 this week). I work during the school year, I make on average I would say $1000-$1200 a month take home during the school year. Car payment is the only bill I pay from this money.

I have about $7000 of zero interest debt from a couple things, mostly car related, other part is from a laptop I bought for school. Both are due early next year, a chunk in April, a chunk in March. (Note here: I am a car enthusiast, there will be no convincing me here, I needed to rebuild the engine in the car, its paid off, has been for a while. Its something I love and enjoy and it raised the value of the car by around $8,000 by my estimation.) I had the money for both purchases I just figured with zero percent it was a no brainer (I used a 1.5% back card on the engine parts so even got a small return there). I intend to keep the money around for these and not touch it as I have been doing to ensure that I won't pay interest on these purchases.

Anyhow, what is the best way to keep this money liquid while also not leaving it stagnant in a Wells Fargo savings account. I obviously know about Ally's savings accounts and plan to open one assuming that is the best way to keep it mostly liquid incase I needed it? If so who has the best account right now? I know Citi's is a bit higher percentage wise but worry that the account might not be as good/convenient.

Would an index fund be a wise choice here? As far as I know the funds in one are liquid but overall its just higher risk right?

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks so much.

TL;DR I have about $17000 cash, $7000 in zero percent debt. What should I do with my money to make it not worthlessly sitting in an account?",1
t3_bz7i80,Trade in new car for something I can pay off quicker.,"So I bought a new 2018 Honda Accord Hybrid in October. Currently it's valued at \~24k. My loan sits at 17k. I'm looking at 6-7k in equity.  I'm paying $350/mo and $760/6mo in insurance. I bought this because I was coming from a 2-seater and wanted the huge increase in practicality, and I was also attracted to it being a hybrid. I don't really struggle to pay for this car but as my student loans get closer to being paid off I'm inspired by fast tracking myself to outright car ownership. This would remove 2 loans from my life sooner. I'm considering something like a 2016-17 Mazda 6 , or similar 2016-17 Honda Accord  for around $13-16k &amp; \~30k miles.  With my equity this new car loan could be 8-10k. This particular trade scenario could remove 1.5-2 years of payments that I currently have, most likely save me money in insurance, and without sacrificing many features that I like in my current car. On paper it seems getting to ownership of a car sooner and freeing up money would be the logical path. Is there value in keeping a more reliable car and one that's still under warranty that I'm not accounting for? What would you do in this scenario?",1

t3_bz7dmm,Confusion regarding SIMPLE IRA and Roth IRA (Income Limits Exceeded),"Hello PF!

I currently need some advice and tax related advice regarding some IRA accounts. To make it short and sweet:

1. I have a SIMPLE IRA plan through my employer and contribute the maximum allowable to the account
2. I was completing backdoor Roth transactions due to income limits being too high, however, since SIMPLE IRA has come into place, this eliminates the backdoor roth option (correct me if I'm wrong)

So what do I do with the current $ in the Roth IRA that I apparently cannot contribute to? I would like to be able to do something with it instead of letting it sit there and slowly gain, and possibly merge with another account.

Last year I had something in the transmission repaired/replaced under warranty. I've read a lot of people keep having problems. I've noticed the engine has started to sound like it's starting to shudder again, even though it still drives normally. The 40k scheduled maintenance is coming up in a few months - I'll mention this to them. Car is no longer under warranty.

* 40k in after-tax investment account. 40k in 401k. Both are in different combinations of mutual funds minimizing fees.
* maxed out 401k contributions
* maxed out HSA contributions
* 10% ESPP
* After above deductions and tax, net monthly take home is $5k
* VHCOL: Housing: rent, utilities, internet = 2.8k
* 150k student loan at 4% apr. I only make the minimum payment since I think it's a low apr. I also get a matching payment from employer.
* 750 credit score. Credit cards paid off every month.
* After all expenses, I save an additional 500 a month that goes into the after-tax investment account.

Conventional wisdom says wait for the next major repair to show up before upgrading. Given this is a known problem car, should I take advantage of the decent trade-in now and get a better, more reliable, more exciting car now before the next service or wait until it actually breaks?

t3_bz4zu8,Not sure if my debit card was charged twice,"I've googled it but can't seem to find what I'm looking for.
On Wednesday I ate at a fast food restaurant and spent $17 with my debit card. The charge showed up immediately as pending in my bank account, and stayed that way through Sunday. For simplicity's sake, let's say I had $100 before and $83 available after.

The over the weekend I spent $82 more dollars on the card and on Sunday at 10pm my account showed $1 available.

Monday around 12pm I deposited $100 into the account, which should have left me with $101 available, right?

Instead, I see Wednesday's $17 charge has been moved to Monday and deducted from the $1 balance, then my $100 deposit applied, leaving me with $84.

I understand that banks reorder transactions, and that merchants can take a few days to send their batch to the bank for processing, but didn't they just take $17 twice? My balance was $1 BECAUSE of the pending hold. What am I missing here?

t3_bz4y0u,"My grandparents have suddenly fallen ill, and my family seems to be lost with how to handle the situation financially or legally","Hello smart and experienced people of /r/personalfinance, I’ve been a long time lurker and have learned a ton on this subreddit, but today I ask for some advice in regards to my grandparents and their situation. I know the key to good responses is having a lot of information in my post, so I will do my best, because this is important to me and my family.

My grandparents are in their mid 90’s living in Florida. My grandma has serve dementia and my grandpa has just fallen and had to have major surgery on a broken hip replacement/leg last week. They said that there was a really good chance that he wasn’t going to survive the operation, and also said that he will most likely need to be put into hospice after some type of rehab/healing. He ended up making it through and is now in the process of making a transition to either rehab/a VA hospital.

My family is distraught and unsure of how to handle the financial situation going on, and also have no type of legal knowledge in regards to estates/wills. My grandpa has a net worth of $750k - 1M, but only about $140k cash that he just pulled out of the stock market sometime after the surgery. He has insurance so his medical bills should not be anything astronomical, but they are only covering 100 days in this rehab facility or hospice. 

My uncle mentioned that he has seen a lawyer to get his will and trust set up around 3 - 4 years ago. My Aunt has power of attorney, but is overwhelmed and having a hard time even understanding his financial situation and could possibly be missing things, or just flat out making wrong decisions. 

So this is where my questions start.

1. My grandparents will need somewhere to go other than my aunts, because she is driven insane by my grandma with dementia. What are the options? Could we somehow leverage the VA hospital/ another program? or is hospice/live in caretaker a better rout all together.

2. It’s to my understanding that he set up his will/trust to pay out after he died peacefully later on down the line in his sleep and didn’t expect anything like this to happen. What is the smart thing to do with his finances this late in the game? Is getting a FA advisor sketchy at this point? Is putting any cash he has sitting in a bank, into a house a bad idea? Can that be gone after if something happens/money becomes an issue for them? 

I’m trying to get just get any information that I can pass on to them. So if you’ve read this far and take the time to comment, I truly appreciate it. Please let me know if I’m missing anything at all.",1

However, we have an great opportunity in the near future to purchase a house for less than market value at around $650K in San Diego, CA. We currently make about $189K with bonuses, no kids, $7K loan on car #1, $9K loan on car #2 (both to be paid off within 2 years), and enough for a 20% down payment ($130K) with emergency savings left over.

t3_bz78v6,Currently on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan - Different Principal Balances/Rates - Need help deciding to Refinance and Invest,"Hello,

I am trying to make some big changes in my life, and am a little overwhelmed with what steps I need to take moving forward with my Debt. I did read the FAQ, and the approach seems to be in general, pay interest rates above 4% as soon as possible. Right now I have $23,000 available to me. I am trying to decide what should be refinanced from my loans, if I should pay my highest interest loan now or refinance, and how much money I should invest. I have, and always will match my 401K because my employer matches. To me, it makes sense to refinance some of my loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29, and have about $3,500 invested. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have received an interest rate offer to pay the following, I would aim to refinance the loans below that are above this rate. Except for the 12% interest, which I am going to pay off in full I believe. I am a little nervous about doing Float rate as I do not want to get stuck with an even higher interest rate. The quote below was off of $57k.

&amp;#x200B;

5 year Fixed-- $1,095.09---5.74%

5 year Float-- $1,052.57---4.11%

7 Year Fixed--$826.15---5.76%

7 Year Float-- $804.29---4.95%

10 Year Fixed--$625.68---5.75%

10 Year Float--$598.19---4.77%

&amp;#x200B;

I currently make a little over $80,000. I plan on improving my budget, eating out less and all that. I am also currently job searching, and might have to take a small cut in base salary to be aligned with my field, which I have a masters in, so I hope in the long run this decision pays dividends. My bonus every year is low, as is my raise (basically inflation increase), so I am hoping my next opportunity has a bit more growth.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my most recent bill on the income based repay plan: 

I have $2k in interest, also wondering if I should pay that off, or because I am thinking about refinancing it does not matter right now. I am pretty disappointed in how much of my payment goes towards interest right now.

t3_bz4vos,"Was lied to by a sales associate at a T-Mobile store about a $20 upgrade fee, can I dispute this with my credit card company?","I’m not sure if this belongs here but didn’t know where else to post:

Apparently this is a common complaint received by T-Mobile customer service. I went in to the T-Mobile store near my home to buy my husband a new Google 3a XL for his upcoming birthday. The phone was advertised for $479 (same price as amazon), so we decided to buy it at the store so that he can start using it today. At this point we are not made aware of any service fees nor did we ask. As the sales associate is ringing us up I noticed briefly the monitor show a sub total of $499 and then it disappeared. When I asked the associate what the discrepancy is, (the phone was advertised as $479 why is it saying $499), he shows me his tablet showing that the phone is in fact ringing up for $479.

I was too lazy to do the math and realize that 7% of $479 should have only totaled to $512.  He then proceeds to tell me that my total is $535 with tax (a $20+tax discrepancy for an upgrade fee that he obviously did not want me to know about). I hand over my credit card and he prints up my receipt and proceeds to FOLD IT UP while telling me about their return policy of 14 days and their restocking fee. 

A couple of hours later I get home, unfold the receipt and noticed a $20 service charge on the itemized receipt. Furious, I called the store and speak to another employee only to find out that the person who sold us the phone and the Manager are both gone for the day and there is nothing he can do for us. I also file a formal complaint with T-Mobile only to be told that there is nothing more they can do for us right now. Can I dispute this with my credit card company? Or is there anything else I should be doing right now?

$20 is not going to break my bank but I am just so upset that this guy lied to my face when I asked him about the $499 subtotal. I was planning on switching to TMobile from my parents family plan to my husbands family plan, but after seeing what they consider customer service, this is no longer an option.",1

t3_bz75sm,Is a HELOC a decent option for me?,"I am a new homeowner, never had a HELOC or even knew what one was prior to buying my first home last November. 

I bought my first home in november 2018 for $235K and put down $50k for a mortgage of $185K. 

Soon after moving in we had some somewhat unexpected costs related to the house pop up totaling $20K. While I do have the money saved to pay it outright, I would prefer to keep that money in the bank and was offered 18 months 0% so I took it. An 18 month 20K loan for free, why not. 

We also recently had our first child and all the expenses that come with that. I was hoping to be able to pay off the loan over the 18 months without tapping into savings to hard but it is proving to not turn out that way. There is 15K remaining and close to $1500/mo in payments. Currently I am pulling about 1K/mo from savings to make these payments. Its not a huge deal, because I originally was just going to pay the whole thing from savings, but its not ideal. 

Financial situation. 

$10K in mutual funds/a few stocks I like

$30K in high yield savings 

$12k between my wife and I's IRAs

$6K in checking


No other debts. 

I would like to pay this remaining 15K off over a longer period of time and without having to keep pulling from savings. I also kind of wish i hadnt put as much down on my house as I did. Interest rates are low and Id rather have gone with 25K down (about 10%) but was new at homebuying and honestly thought I had to put at least 20% down. 

My local credit union will give me a 15 year HELOC @ 3.25% for 12 months and then variable rate after that which is just the prime rate. It seems to me if I do this it would essentially be like I just put 15K less down on my house and I would just have a slightly higher mortgage payment if I consider them together which I would have preferred anyway. This way i can stop pulling from savings and have a MUCH more manageable payment at a good rate and go back to contributing to savings every month instead of drawing from it. 

Does this seem like a solid plan? Anything I should know? Any reason I shouldn't do this? Really just anyone's opinions at all are appreciated.",1

I was wondering about Vanguard Solo 401k fees or I guess how Vanguard does fees in general.

t3_bz21ms,Considering buying a home. Insane?,"Some background:

Early 30's. In marketing. Live in the south, so COL is reasonable. In the past have made good money ($90k+), but currently working as a contractor working part-time, making about $50k/yr. But as a contractor, my taxes are high so only really taking home about $3k/mo, and our health insurance is $500/mo on top of that. Add in car insurance, food, etc, and my $3k/mo is problematic. 

Wife is going back to school and is currently unemployed. I have about $50k in savings/investment accounts. Wife will graduate in 2 years in a medical field, expect her to make $60k+ upon graduation.  It's a really high-demand field, so that part is fairly rock solid. 

I'm in a bit of an odd situation. Money is clearly a bit tight at the moment, but I am fairly confident I can pretty easily get a job making $65k+. And, it's all really just a ""survive for 2 years and then we'll have a much higher combined income"" situation. 

Now, here's the thing. We have to move to her new school, which is an area with high rent (relative to my region). A 1br apartment goes for about $1,300/mo. Again, I think I can quickly get a job that would make this affordable, but I don't want to count on it. I only have a guaranteed take-home of $3k/mk for now, which would be a stretch to survive on with $1.3k rent. 

But I've been looking, and there are nice townhouses going for about $170k in the area. I have good credit. I could put down $30k or so and probably get a mortgage for about $700/mo, making this all a lot easier. But, here are my concerns:

1) Really never had a desire to buy at the moment. I'd much prefer to be a renter with lower risk for the time being. 

2) Only know we will be living in the area for 2 years while my wife finished school. Then who knows.
 
3) would have to put a big chunk of my savings down as a down payment. 

These 3 things make me think it's silly, but I can't get the idea out of my head that I could be buying a townhome for $700/mo vs renting a tiny apartment for $1,300/mo. Even if we leave in 2 years, I could rent it out or sell it. But I know the general rule is ""don't buy unless you plan on living somewhere for 5 years or more.""

Any insight here at all? Everything is telling me that buying is a bad idea, but the numbers are really compelling. Really appreciate your help on this.

Edit: should note that my wife will be working odd jobs and whatnot during school, so she will provide some income. Just nothing super substantial.",1

Which I know isn't bad for 5 years of college and only working part-time. The issue is, I had to take a financial hit in a variety of areas that left me in collections: After finally reviewing my credit report, after years of hiding it under the rug until I graduated, I made a spreadsheet of the collectors and amounts. I discovered I have a total of **$2,680 in collection debt.** Ranging from old credit cards I was charged off for, medical/emergency room bills, to cable companies from not paying the last 2 month of services. All of this stemming from negligence and only working part-time because of the grind engineering classes required. I also have a current credit card, and my only open line of credit, that is a $3,000 limit and almost maxed out. 

Now that I am making a salary, I have calculated how much my checks will be after taxes roughly every 2 weeks, and also calculated what my monthly expenses are. 

With a take home monthly income of 3600 a month and monthly expenses ranging at about $1,180 (including rent) I am trying to figure out the best way to handle my debt. I have read on multiple threads about specific ways to handle collections which has me worried because a big goal for me is to get my credit out of the low 500s.

My goal is to save up and get a new car within a year but obviously isn't feasible given my credit and debt situation. I also am very confused on how to handle the debt collections.

Any advice on how I should attack this financial situation would be great.",1

I have $32k in high-yield savings (2.25% APY), $23k in 401k (maxing out this year, but not last). I have $1.5k sitting in stock market index funds. I've been following the advice of a financial adviser I saw once last year, who told me that if I want to use my money to make a big purchase (like a house) in the next 5 years, then I shouldn't have it in the market.

I feel like I'm approaching the I-have-enough-money-for-a-down-payment stage (I don't plan on buying a house more than $250k), and I should be getting a substantial raise soon. I also don't plan on buying a house for another 2 years, at least.

I'm thinking I should change/be more active about my financial strategy. Should I start to invest a portion of my paychecks in the market from now on? Say, 50% in the market, 50% in savings until savings hits a cap of 50k? Am I maybe missing something much bigger in all of this?

t3_bz4dlx,"Question about the PF prime directive and how it applies to Roth IRAs, Thrift Savings Plan, and Ultra Low Cost (Or No Cost) Mutual Funds","I'm currently a 28 year old pilot in the Air Force making ~$100k/year and my wife is an aviation safety consultant making ~$30-35k/year (sometimes $4k+/month, sometimes zero -- e.g. govt shutdown).  Our taxes are relatively low due to tax exempt allowances and combat zone tax exclusions, so we've been contributing to Roths since we expect our income to go up substantially in the future and have relatively low taxes now.

My retirement strategy for the past few years has been to max out my Roth Thrift Savings Plan ($19k/year, 0.04% ER) account taking advantage of the 5% matching from the military's new retirement system.  I have a Roth IRA with Vanguard I don't currently contribute to, but I maintain a balanced 3 fund profile there from previous contributions.  Recently, all of my shares that weren't admiral shares were automatically converted and the expense ratios went down accordingly. The rest of my savings has been towards expanding my emergency fund for the future, potential house down payment, and replacing both of our aging cars with newer used cars.

My wife maxes a Roth IRA with Fidelity taking advantage of their zero &amp; low cost funds using a 3 fund profile and saves towards our house and increasing our emergency fund as well.

My questions are:

1) With the ""race to the bottom"" on index fund ERs, should I now be prioritizing my IRA over my TSP (assuming I always max out matching) or leave things the way they are?  The prime directive sort of says maybe you could prioritize TSP over IRA sometimes.  Roth IRAs seem to have more flexibility and are less painful to withdraw from when you hit retirement compared to a Roth TSP, but I have limited understanding on this.  It seems like the best reason to use TSP historically was the ridiculously low ERs, but they've slowly crept up and met/almost met/exceeded publicly available mutual funds.

2) Is there a more effective way for my wife to invest given our situation and that she's self employed?

I am clueless when it comes to car insurance and need help picking which plan/provider suits me best financially.,"So, as I mentioned, I have never owned a car before. I drove in high school but shared a car with my two sisters which was insured by my parents. I've lived in an urban area for the last five years, so I didn't really have the need for a car given there's plenty of public transportation (and little parking) in my area. However, I recently moved to a more suburban area just outside the city (5-10 minute drive) and noticed the bus stops heading downtown (where I work just about daily) are 20 mins on foot from my house. I take them if I have time but find myself spending a lot of money weekly on Ubers.

I live in Ohio, about two hours from my parents, and my whole family is heading to Boston for a wedding 2 weeks from now. Last week, my Mother moved her parents into assisted living across the country to Portland to be closer to my Aunt, which left her to deal with selling their home and taking care of their possessions. She offered for me to pick my grandparent's car up (their house is a couple hours from Boston) after we go to the wedding and drive it back to Ohio. I figured why not as it would be helpful to have in my new location.

My driving record is flawless and I have never been in an accident. Also, if it makes a difference the car is a 1998 Buick sedan in exceptional shape for its age (as it was rarely driven and my grandfather was obsessed with keeping it running well).

We’ve saved $1.2M across her 401k ($300,000), combined Vanguard IRAs ($300,000) and Roth IRAs ($200,000). We put away $2,600/mo by maxing both Roths and her 401k. We also got a $400k inheritance (factored In to the $1.2M) that adds to our investment holdings.

Based on the Dave Ramsey retirement calculator, using the 7% annual return that accounts for inflation, we’re on track for $4.8 million at age 62. Using a 4% draw down, that would account for an annual income of $192,000 or $16,000 month in current dollars.

A couple questions:

1.	I’m wondering how much we are likely to have to pay in taxes on that $16,000/mo?
2.	Given that we are likely to own our home outright at age 62, and may have additional inheritance of $1M+ by then, I’m wondering how to factor what other expenses we are likely to incur. Would it be crazy to think that we could do four trips of $10k each per year and still have sufficient cushion?

t3_bzaqbl,"(US, 23) $35,000 in credit card debt and $10,000 in student loans. How bad is my situation?","Hi everyone,

I am in a tough financial situation. I am graduating with my Bachelor's in Business Administration at the end of August from a prestigious university that is well known for its business program, and as the title shows, I am in a lot and a lot of debt.

Right now my credit card debt is at $28,000 and will be $35,000+ at the end of August once tuition and other expenses are factored in and taken care of. My subsidized student loans are sitting at $10,000. At least on the bright side, I will be graduating, yay!

Before anyone asks me why I am in such a shitty position, it was very hard to put myself through community college and then university after being disowned and growing up in the system! I had to keep my poverty background a secret and compensate for not having parents or a high status life by fronting the costs for many things myself through debt (rent, clothing, food, maintenance and upkeep). Which, if you think about it, is not really that much money. That's about $700-1500 average living expenses per MONTH. That is ALL I need to not only survive but be HAPPY. I cannot FIND a steady income source that provides this.

Thankfully, taking on insanely risky debt at such an early, formative period of my adulthood allowed me many of the blessings I have today, which is 

1. a body that is alive and functioning, mostly 

2. a brain that has not succumbed to mental illness, and functions, mostly and 

3. a formal, American, university education to my name.

So my total debt is what is left over for 6 years of living expenses, after what I have been able to pay and continue paying from sporadic work and scholarships. I started out with nothing to my name, so here is where I am at. I have probably paid about $7000 in interest over those 6 years alone. I also had a very difficult time between years 3-6 as I became homeless, was temporarily disabled due to an injury, got fired and could not do basic things such as cook and prepare food, or clean...so yes, you are very correct that I delivered all my food and ate take out until I could use my limbs to produce whatever income I could afterwards so I can then purchase and prepare my own food.

Basically, life sucks. Paying to live sucks too. Not being able to afford living because you have to study before you can earn money also sucks. I don't need to be judged on that. I just need a plan to get out of this, and good news, I am graduating, yay! Which means all I need is a full-time job after I am no longer forced to go to classes for a piece of paper. I can just go to work 9-5 instead, which is cool. I can even work after 5PM as well to whenever, which is also cool. I can do all that. I actually have been wanting to do all that but I haven't been able to because I need to graduate first. And have work experience. I don't have both though, so graduating will have to do until I can have both.

And stat for my job hunt for the past 3 years:

1000+ job applications and counting!
25+ first round interviews
15+ final round interviews
2 interviews where I was the shortlist candidate

I have already checked out every business/finance/startup/corporate website, forum, help whatever bullshit there is. None of their advice applies to me. It is for people who come from privilege. Of my comparable peers, I am at the absolute bottom of hireability. My admission into my program was a complete anomaly and I am shocked I have not dropped out yet. I am being completely frank and honest, not self-defeating or negative. People like me should NOT enter rigorous or prestigious programs if they have no connections or do not come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. I only exist to make other candidates and students look better for being higher on the social hierarchy, and to raise applicant numbers for everything so that only the select few can be chosen. It is how the world works. 

Out of all the suggestions people have given me, it seems that my problem is, I am too proud and confident in my abilities and background than my work history leads on, and I am over reliant on the education I do have. I have not tried lying yet, since I have no reason to and there is nothing in any of my job applications I should even be ashamed of to conceal or misrepresent.

t3_bz690l,"I'm using my savings card as a debit card, is this alright?","First of all, I am from Brazil, and am not familiar at all with the finance related terms in english, please ask me for details if I wrote anything that doesn't seem right.

Well, I am not really someone that knows much about finances, but I don't really spend more money than I need, and I have been using my savings card as a debit card, for daily needs, such as food on the university cafe while all day out of home, but nothing that takes a huge load of money from there, usually, and that while keeping a nice income every month.

I thought all was fine and well like this, with my money yielding profit, but my aunt told me I should make a checking account, because the savings account won't profit me properly if I keep on using the money in there.

The thing is, I am receiving some profit on my account, some quite inconsistent profit that I gain everyday, but that sums to a decent profit-like amount at the end of the month (I check that on my bank's app, and well, while I can't say for sure, I always assumed this random money I gain everyday as 'CRED JUROS', as written in my language, was, well, the profit, but I may be gravely mistaken). Is there really a problem with using my savings money frequently, even if it is a reasonable amount compared to the income?

If I am not mistaken about the 'CRED JUROS' being the profit I am supposed to receive, I'd say keeping all my money on the savings account would be more profitable than having my account static while depositing half the amount I am depositing right now so I can use the other half on a checking card, since by depositing the full amount of money I currently am depositing would have me profit more than depositing half of it, while I haven't spent it, since it is a daily thing.

So, yeah, is it alright for me to use it as a debit card, or is it better to get a checking card as my aunt suggests?",1

Just looked at my online banking, and over the course of four days, last month, multiple purchases of 6-8000 at a time have been made from my bank account, totalling just over £70,000

Barclays Bank were pretty ok about it, they said it’s likely a cloned card - because they considered the amount of be quite large, they wouldn’t be able to refund the money immediately and would have to investigate, but that I shouldn’t worry. 

Trouble is, after reading a ton about Barclays refusing to refund money, I’m now worried they’re Going to conclude the investigation and tell me I’m at fault.

I currently live in the middle of nowhere, and love the convenience of buying things that would normally require a 5 hour drive to civilization.

In March, my annual Prime subscription was up and after a less-than-stellar customer service experience, I cancelled.

I still get free shipping- all items marked as Prime eligible ship free if you have $25 dollars in your cart. This has helped curb the impulse buys of dumb crap. Letting things sit in my cart for a week has forced me to be more conscious of what I'm buying and now I think through those useless things I don't really need.

This probably isn't the best decision for everyone. My area doesn't have a Whole Foods, or Prime Same-Day. Groceries are cheap where I live, so I got no use out of Prime Pantry. I have other streaming services for video and music. Ultimately, I wish I had cancelled sooner.",1
t3_bz601j,Need Help Budgeting After Multiple Failed Attempts,"Hi there. Quick background about me and as to why I'm making this post. The past 3 summers , I've made around 5-6000 each year and every time, within half a year I've wasted it all. I'm very lucky to have had those opportunities in high school and my freshman year, but I want to manage my money much better this year as I really felt the consequences of having spent all my money too fast this year. I wanted to provide the details and have you guys help me and critique me if that's alright.

&amp;#x200B;

So, before taxes, I will be making around $13,000 this summer. I live in NYC, and I know my company takes off taxes for me for thinks like Social, Medicare, etc. so that I don't have to, but I'm not sure what I'll end up with after taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I assume it's around 40% so I'll be left with $8000. I borrowed 300 from both my mom and sister so that leaves me at 7400. My little brother did not lock down a job and he's going into college as well so I want to leave him with around $500 leaving me at 6900. I need to leave at least 1500 in both my checking and saving I believe so as to not be docked by fees, and making that money untouchable, leaving me with 3900. This is where it gets tricky for me. Having planned this far is already a huge step for me and I really want to hold myself to that untouchable 3000. But I'm also a big spender. I want to give myself 1500ish for miscellaneous, school stuff, and fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

The BIG question is, is 1400 enough to put into savings/investments, and if so, where the heck do I put it because my parents don't know about any of that and neither do I.

t3_bz5zms,Introductory 0% APR Credit Cards,"Greetings smart people,

I have a picture in my head of how I could really benefit from a 0% APR credit card and I wanted to make sure that I’m not missing anything before I apply.

I’ll start off by briefly explaining my situation. I graduated 2.5 years ago and have been working as an engineer ever since. I have no real debt (I’m very lucky), and no dependents so I have been able to save a substantial portion of my income.  I will be returning to school for a master’s program this fall, and I am planning on not working at all during my first semester.

I have been looking at 0% Introductory APR credit cards because I’m hoping that I could rely on one for basically all of my daily purchases while I have no income. Almost all of my money is invested, and I would prefer not to cash out any of my holdings while I’m in school. If I can simply pay the minimum payment on the card every month while accumulating no interest or late fees, then I can pay off the debt next summer (the card I’m looking at has 0% APR for 15 months). By next summer I will (hopefully) have a paid internship that I can use to pay off all of the debt.

Can anyone see any flaws in this line of thinking? Like I said, I want to keep as much of my savings invested as I can and this will allow me to do that. Are there any permanent credit score issues that could come from only paying the minimum monthly payment every month?

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1

t3_bz5udn,Dealing with Verizon,"Last summer I had an account with Verizon go into collections.

However, it first went into Verizon's internal collections department.

Their collections department never sent any sort of paperwork or called me claiming I owed them money. The last correspondence I received from Verizon was a bill. 

At the time, I did not have the money to pay the account.

Now the account is with an outside collection agency called IC System. However IC System is not listed on my credit, Verizon is.

While the account was with Verizon, they added a nearly $100 ""Collection fee"".

IC System is not the ones who added this charge.

After speaking with Verizon's executive office, they blamed IC System for adding this fee, and after I engaged in a 3-way call with Verizon and IC System, Verizon suddenly walked back what they said and claimed ""well even if we did add it, we won't remove it"".

I wish to settle this debt and get it behind me, but I'm not paying this fee if Verizon will not remove it. In fact I talk to my state's AG and they said it's not even allowable for them to add a fee.

Verizon has been sued many times in the past and they are pretty much stonewalling me trying to get this fixed. 

They are 

The balance on my credit report does not reflect this charge and is not accurate as required under the FDCPA.

Verizon has now flagged my account to automatically transfer me to the outside collection agency and won't help me, they said ""we are not removing any charges and this matter is now closed"" and hung up.

The outside collection agency is not listed on my credit report, Verizon is, therefore the onus is on them to fix this.

My in-laws are terrible with money. Multiple bankruptcies. Overspending. Missed payments. Bad Credit. You know the drill.

They have a 2013/14 Buick Enclave that is almost paid off, but it needs at least a 3k repair to fix the A/C (Texas heat). They don’t have the money. In fact they already paid over a $1000 trying to fix the problem.

I don’t want to give them money because I’m not sure it will even fix the problem or the car won’t have another big issue in the near term and now I’ve set a precedent for just fixing their problems. I also do not think a loan is reasonable/I’d ever actually get my money back, but maybe this is the least bad option?

It was suggested they trade it in and I co-sign the note so they get approved but I don’t like that idea because then my credit is damaged if they miss a payment.

I’m considering buying their car from them and trading it in and “leasing” them a new car. I figure at least this way I am in control of the Asset and the payments (if I finance it).

So why would I do this? 
Well they watch our son a lot since I travel and my wife and I both work. I feel obligated to help because they help us all the time and I am able financially to do so. 
I also do not want them driving around in an unsafe vehicle with my kid.

Unfortunately, as a result, this led to me seeking happiness in buying new things. After getting the help I needed, I managed to accumulate a total of $8,600 in credit card debt. Now that I have my head straight, I am doing everything in my power to fix this. As I have been adjusting, there have been moments where I have not had to make late payments, which resulted in lowering my credit score drastically. Now, I am unable to get accepted in obtaining a loan or credit card that has little to no interest. In my current place of employment, I am making just enough to pay all my bills. At this point, I may be forced to resort in selling personal belongings in order to alleviate the debt. Is there any other options someone could recommend to me?",1

Are these people just bad planners? Why not buy a car in cash instead of paying on it for 5 years+? It seems like every adult I talk to is in some kind of debt and it's normal for their paycheck to be drained each cycle. I think it's absolutely insane for anyone to live like this.

t3_bz5ge3,Is being an AU on my dad's primary CC preventing me from getting my own cards?,"So I'm currently a student, with a Discover IT Student card, which I got in April 2019. My dad added me to his card as an AU in early May 2019. 

His income (and spending) is much much greater than mine. He doesn't carry a balance, and doesn't miss payments. 

Credit Karma currently shows my credit utilization at under 5%, but the total balance is almost $700. Only about $40 of that is from my card, the rest is from his. My income is about $2000. 

I applied for a wells fargo retail card (Microcenter) in late May, and was declined. I'm trying to call Wells Fargo and get a reason, but its Wells Fargo. I want to get the new Chase Student CC, but am worried that I'll get declined for that too.

I'm pushing 40.

Currently, I net about $3,850/mo, have about 21k left of my own student loans — 4-6.5% that could be forgiven in 3-4 years — and pay around 30% net to rent. It's a bigger city, but I might be able to get that down to 25% after this lease is up. I devote 10% toward utilities, and I keep things fairly tight in the eating out and entertainment department —10% altogether.

I anticipate ~&lt;5% toward child support and servicing the rest of the community debt she holds.

All told, I can clear 16%+ gross/mo. There's no 401k match at work. Oh, and my car has 160k+ miles on it, but is paid for.

In the Personal Income Spending Flowchart, I'm kinda where the red and green meet blue.

Right now I know I need a few years to get up to 3 mos. backup and to bank my car replacement too, ~$20k altogether, but I'm not sure how much to devote to those student loans in the meantime. They are low-interest and will likely be forgiven, tax-free, in the next few years. Public service workers be like ... 

I'd love to put money toward home equity instead of rent, but its definitely a seller's market here, and I am *nowhere* near a down payment for a house. My credit is pristine (820+) though, but that and a kick to my nuts would be a kick to my nuts with good credit.

Do I just hunker down with this plan for the next few years? Is there a way to leverage current interest rates and my credit to kickstart my savings plan? I want to have enough liquid for emergencies, especially when my car kicks it, but I want to start making up for lost time as quickly as possible.

t3_bz5bx0,I like the idea of Charle's Schwab's subscription advisors,"\*DISCLAIMER: I do not have a stake in Charles Schwab. This is an ""average joe"" expressing an impression on a new way to handle personal finance.

&amp;#x200B;

Since getting the email promoting Schwab's new program, I've been giving it a hard thought on how this could be beneficial. When I made my personal brokerage account, I did so with the explicit thought of minimizing the costs for my investing. Essentially taking out the middle man. I never thought about paying for the advisor per call because I didn't want to pay $25 per call.

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know about it. Schwab will charge you $300 up front and $30 per month for *unlimited* one-on-one calls with Schwab financial advisors. Sounds like a lot when you consider that upcharge. So here's the math behind it:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\-------$300 upfront

\+ $30 \* 12 monthly

\----------------------------

\-------$660 annually

&amp;#x200B;

VS

&amp;#x200B;

$25 per call

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

This means that if you were to opt for the subscription, you would need to activate your unlimited subscription at least 27 times in a year to make this service worth the money, otherwise you'll be better off sticking with paying per call.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't earn enough money yet to consider paying this amount of money, so people like me that are just starting out ought to wait a while before going this route. After all, that $600 a year would more than cover your online stock trading fees. However, I will recommend it if you already have a lot of money tied up in your brokerage account and want to get a second opinion before you make a trade based on the latest craze in the news. I know I'll use it when I get to that point in my life where a single bad decision could lose you thousands of dollars in a week.",1

t3_bz5afr,Question about a Sallie Mae Tuition Answer Loan in Navient,"My student loans are currently being serviced by Navient. I’ve called them and they confirmed over the phone that all of my loans are in good standing (I’ve been overpaying them for months after I went through a rehabilitation program). I have also contacted the National Student Loan Database and had them confirm the same on the phone, including the loan details that I can verify on the Navient portal. Currently I have a consolidated subsidized loan at 6.875% interest rate with $20k remaining, and a consolidated unsubsidized loan also at 6.875% interest rate with around $28k remaining.

However, in my Navient portal, there is an additional loan, called “Steven’s Tuition Answer.” This is a Sallie Mae Tuition Answer loan that my father took out (not me). The original principal was $6,417 and now the current balance is over $17,327, as I’m assuming he never paid anything towards it and it’s been over ten years. I didn’t even know this loan existed until it showed up in my Navient portal.

I have called Navient numerous times to get more info about this loan but nobody has been able to help me, as they consider the loan a “charge-off,” which gets handled by a third party vendor. Since I didn’t take the loan out, it makes it even more challenging. I am looking for (written) confirmation that I am not responsible for this loan and that it will not impact my credit score (I do not see it on my Credit Karma account). How should I proceed to get assurances this loan that he took out won’t impact my credit score or that I will not be liable to pay it back? If it’s gone this long without any payment, why that hasn’t already happened?",1
t3_bz58bj,Questions Regarding Using Balance Transfer to Free up Cash Flow,"A little about me--I always pay off my balance in full at the end of each month (most of the time before due) but I've incurred some charges (12.5K this month, all on my CSR) due to unforeseen circumstances. I have already paid off 4K this week so my current balance is around 8.5K and I'm thinking about transferring that balance to any of my other Chase cards with 0% interest thru 8/2020 balance transfer offers.  I have several cards with these offers as I have never done a balance transfer before.

Now I have the means to pay it off, but I would like to transfer the balance so that I can use that cash for other things.  If I transfer the balance to one of these 0% cards, will my credit be affected if I do not make monthly payments for a while?  I would like to use the $8500 that I would use to pay off the card as a mini loan essentially to do some crypto trading.  I will be paying off the balance in full long before the end of the 0% period.

I know I will pay a 4% fee and I am perfectly fine with that. I just want to know the potential ramifications to my credit if I do this.

t3_bz54sj,Partner and I are moving in together. How should we split our expenses?,"My partner and I are moving in together and we're trying to settle on an equitable way to split our expenses.

We both have great jobs

I make $95k (before tax) and spend about $28k of that

They make about $250k (before tax) and spend about $35k of that

I have a net worth of about $120k

They have a net worth of about $300k, despite being a few years younger

Our shared expenses are:

Rent ($2000)

Groceries ($300)

Utilities including Netflix, Spotify, renter's insurance, etc. (average $140)

Total shared expenses of $2440 per month. All of our other spending is separate.

So here's the question: Given that we are both able to easily afford our lifestyle (regardless or how we split expenses), how should we choose to split?

Does it make sense to split 50/50? Or should we be paying different fractions based on income or net worth?

t3_bz2gwf,Collection Agency Contacting My Father for Grandmother's (Deceased) Nursing Home Bills,"Hey Guys,

I have a question regarding the liability of my father to pay my grandmother's nursing home bills. About 1.5 years ago my grandmother with dementia ended up in the hospital and was subsequently discharged to a nursing home where she lived for about a year and subsequently passed away. She was initially insured under medicare/medicaid but lost her coverage because while she was in the hospital her bank account grew too large from her social security benefits and she was automatically removed from her insurance plan as she had too many assets in the bank. This happened while my father was attempting to obtain guardianship and this process took several months. Essentially there was a period of time where he was unable to access these funds in order to spend them on her care. After he obtained guardianship and spent the money, he reapplied for medicaid/medicare and her nursing home care was covered. This left a period of about 3-4 months in the middle where her care was not covered and the nursing home has been contacting him with bills for $8,000 directed at him for her care. The latest is that he has received a letter from a collection agency with this sum. He resides in NJ and the nursing home is in NJ. Is he responsible for paying these bills? Obviously if it's going to collection then it could ruin his credit which is obviously not ideal. Would an elder law attorney be helpful in this case or is there a different professional that we should contact that is more suited for answering questions about this problem?

t3_bz2gij,Structured Settlement Annuity. Frozen?,"To keep this brief, i'm looking for some advice if there is anything I can do. 

When I was very young my mother passed away, it was a wrongful death and we received a settlement. 

This was a structured settlement annuity according to the paper work I have. Since this happened when I was so young I never thought to understand but I am now getting close to the age when i'm able to receive my lump sum and something is very troubling to me. 

How the settlement was set up was that when I get to a certain age I receive one lump sum of money. This money is tax free but the money is just sitting in an account frozen. From what I gather is that in many cases structured settlements are supposed to gain interest over time but in my case I do not, I DON'T GET WHY. Over almost 30 years this amount would have likely doubled or even tripled. 

Has anybody heard of a structured settlement being frozen and not gaining any interest? From what I have gathered the insurer paid into the annuity, so is the financial institution holding the money gaining all that interest? I talked to the institution and they said it is not gaining any interest and that I will receive the one lump sum on this date. 

Is there anything I can do to get this money faster so that it is still not sitting there so I can at least invest it and grow it? Or are structured settlements iron clad. My dad is who set this account up many years ago, he also passed over 10 years ago as well so I have no details on how or why it was set up this way. His thinking was that if I wait until i'm at a certain age that I wouldn't spend it all and would already have my life set up so that by the time I get it, I don't need it and can just invest it. Which I understand that thought but having that money just sit there frozen just kills me knowing how much return we could have got. 

Does anybody know anything about structured settlements? Does anybody know if there is anything I can do? Should I be gaining interest or is that something that is unique to each case and the terms of the contract?",1

t3_bz52tg,How do HSA rollovers work?,"For some background, I am a healthy 25 year old with a HDHP and HSA through HSA bank. I currently have about $600 in my account. I am interested in investing this money in an index fund and not touching it until I retire (assuming I stay healthy). My father has done this and has over 100k sitting in his HSA. He has saved receipts for his healthcare expenses for the past 10 years that he will use to reimburse himself tax free during retirement. Seeing as I'm in my mid 20s, I think this has awesome growth potential if I stay healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that HSA bank requires $1000 to begin investing. Additionally, you need to maintain a cash account balance of $5000 to avoid paying a $5/month fee. This is frustrating because I am probably 2 years away from hitting 5k in my account. My employer pays whatever fees are required to provide employees with HSA bank, but they do not contribute to my HSA or cover any investment fees.

My questions are:

1) Can I rollover my funds to another HSA provider (such as Fidelity), and begin no-fee, first dollar investing? Is this allowed? My employer would continue to have my pre-tax money sent to HSA bank.

2) If yes, would I then have to continually rollover funds from HSA Bank to Fidelity? I would probably do this every 1k or so

3) Is this going to be a total pain in the ass come tax season?

I will be able to move up fast in the company because this office is growing, and I could look at going from \~75000 to \~85000 in around a year and a half to two years.

Offer 2: Rotational position at manufacturing company. The starting salary is $50000 and I'm going to have to relocate to one of their manufacturing offices. I get a $1200/month stipend to cover housing expenses (rent, rental furniture, utilities), a flexible spending account that covers lunches, and gas.

I have a 401(k) with my previous employer that is mostly Roth.  However, there's a fair chunk that came from pre-tax contributions, before Roth was offered.  That amounts to about $27k.

I'm a big proponent for Roth, so I don't really need convincing on whether or not Roth is a good choice (I'm also young - early 30s); I'm more looking for thoughts on if this is a good time or if it's worth it for that amount.  I understand I would owe the taxes now if I move forward, and I also wouldn't mind some links if anyone has a good calculator on figuring out what that amount might be (my searching only seems to find ""is Roth right for you""-type calculators).

t3_bz4v6s,Tax Implications of M1 Finance?,"Hello, I got drawn to the fact that M1 Finance uses a ""pie"" model and also fractional shares. It also has automatic investment, which simplifies things in life.  I have a question or two about potential tax implications years down the line.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently made a pie of 25 different stocks, so pretty much my ""pie"" is 25 different securities. These are all dividend stocks from major companies on the Stock Market. I initially will put $1000 into my M1 account, but I also want to setup an automatic investment of $100 a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, comes the hard part with the taxes. Essentially, once per week M1 Finance will make 25 trades on my behalf buying a fraction of each of those shares by evenly splitting up the $100. This adds up to 1,300 trades per year(52 weeks x 25 different trades per week = 1,300). Not to mention any dividend payments these stocks will pay me.  This can be a lot of accounting at the end of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a bad strategy? From what I understand EVERY TIME you buy or sell any security, you create a taxable event. This can become a problem one year from now when I have to do my taxes. Anybody have experience with M1 Finance, especially the taxes portion of it? Anybody did their taxes with Turbotax and import the 1099 from M1 onto there? I know M1 Finance provides you with all the 1099 forms you need at the end of the year. Will all pertinent info be in there regarding 1,300 trades?

PS: I will crosspost this as I am not sure which sub to ask about this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have va mortgage on a home worth \~600k with 360k remaining.

Some unfortunate events have occurred. 

We have 120k in 0 apr credit card / personal loan debt now.

After the 0 apr period.  It would take about 1-2 years to pay off the debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

We are thinking about taking advantage of the low interest rates and refinancing our va mortgage to a 450 - 480k mortgage.

The interest rate would be at a 0.25% less than our current rate.

Refinancing would cost about 10k.

 

Our question is

Should refinance the maximum amount (480k) and have some wiggle room with cash or should we refinance the lower amount (450k) but things will be really tight to pay off the rest of the debt for about 6-10 months?",1

Highly annoying situation. 

My wife just checked her credit score and it is low, around 670 and we see that there 3 delinquent payments on there from VW Credit.

Mine is about 750 and we have petty much exactly the same credit history. Both moved to the states around same time and started from scratch. Lots of shared accounts.

We received an invoice from VW Credit a few years back with no explanation (wasn’t a regular car payment). We called up and were told this was an outstanding amount. Called again and were told this could have been for damages at need of lease, at point if return for the inspection the guy said everything was fine. 

Called back and said it was because we had returned the car early.

We returned the car week or so early to get another VW car and the dealership where we got it from said there wouldn’t be an issue as we were getting another lease.

We ended up paying the invoice but now see we have been dinged. This was 2 years ago.

t3_bz4fsp,Thinking about trading in my car for an equivalent SUV. Rational or irrational decision?,"I have a 2016 Toyota Corolla with 56000 miles. My parents gave me a loan when I bought it, so I have been paying them monthly for the car. I still owe about $5000 on the car with 2 years left on my payment plan to my parents. So in the eyes of whoever I trade it in to, it is completely paid off.  


I have been looking into trading it in for a used/CPO 2016-2018 SUV with 40000 miles or less due to the fact that occasionally I need to drive around large items (Pelican, SKB cases, large boxes, etc) for work. I can usually get those items to fit in my car, but it is very tight, takes up all of the trunk, rear seats, and passenger seat, and the \[larger items\]([https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/transport-case/protector/1690](https://www.pelican.com/us/en/product/cases/transport-case/protector/1690)) barely fit through the rear doors, making it difficult to get the items in and out by myself without scratching the interior of my car's rear doors. I usually drive these larger items for about 5-6 round trips a year(usually a 3-5 hour drive each way) and drive a total of 20000 miles a year for work purposes. So I don't need an SUV constantly, but when I do have to squeeze my car full of stuff, it really sucks. On the personal side, it would also be nice to have a larger car for my GF and me to have for beach/road trips that we do each summer as well as planning ahead a few years to have a larger car for children. My biggest worries are that I really like my car now and have maintained it really well. Used/CPO SUV's with lowish mileage are also likely to have been maintained well, but I don't want to end up with a problematic car.

&amp;#x200B;

I am getting a small raise from my company that would cover the cost of the car on a monthly basis plus some, but since the raise is not specifically for the car, I could also just use that money and save that money for future needs. Even without the raise I can afford the new car without it making too much of a dent in my budget, but I don't want to unnecessarily spend $1500-$2000 extra a year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in the minds of r/personalfinance, would going through with this be rational or irrational?

t3_byzx66,impartial opinions on whether or not to continue with this home purchase/sale process we're in,"TL;DR I can't decide if our current plan we have to buy/sell homes is financially sound or not.

PREFACES:
- Posting from a throwaway account, my real one is personally-identifiable.
- I know we're in good shape financially for the most part; I understand a lot of people here are not and I'm certainly not complaining about my situation at all. It's been a lot of hard work to get to where we are even with the privilege &amp; advantages we've had all along, and I just want some opinions on whether I'm considering a rational, standard life decision for someone in my position, or making a huge mistake.

We've owned our home since 2003. Only $50K left on the mortgage. Kids ages 14 and 12, public schools. No student debt, no credit card debt, one car owned outright and should be fine for several more years, one is a $150/mo payment, only $2k left on the note. Income is $120k plus a little extra here and there from small business my wife is trying to build and occasional side work for me. We currently save the max amount allowed every month into Roth IRAs for each of us and keep about $30K in liquid emergency savings. Got $40k in 529 education savings accounts for the kids' educations as well.

For years we've wanted:
- a little more living space, mainly a home office / hobby room my wife and I can share
- a little more privacy for everyone; separation between parent/kid bedrooms, mainly
- no further from (and preferably a little closer to) our city's downtown, where I work and expect to for years; our kids go to schools close to downtown as well
- a spot with more walkable/bike-able shops/restaurants/parks nearby

We're in a pretty big (top 20 in the US) city, and a fast-growing real estate market with people migrating here like crazy — it's a sellers' market for sure, so while we'd do pretty well selling our house, it's natural that it'd be tough to buy something bigger and closer in.

After over two years of looking we finally found a place that ticks all the boxes, and as a bonus, it has a second master suite that, with not a lot of little work &amp; investment, can be set up as an income-generating Airbnb/VRBO space (my wife would enjoy managing that), and/or an ideal private guest space for when our parents come to visit.

I mentioned we'd been looking for over two years; it had gotten to the point where we were seriously considering adding a 2nd story onto our existing place instead of moving.

So, we're under contract on this new house, getting our place ready to go on the market, but I find myself waffling about the finances of it all. We're still in the option period where we could just walk away.

The new house is $430K. It's priced very well for the location because it's older and needs some improvements. The plan is to put down 20% so the new 30-year mortgage amount would be $344k. Our place will probably sell for $310-$340. After subtracting the agent fees, closing costs from both transactions, and down payment on the new place, I think we can make around $190 on the sale, and then immediately spend $20-30k on improvements to the new place, including setting up the room we can use as a rental. 

So, in all that, it seems like we still come out with potentially over $150k in our pockets, but somehow I'm managing to still be nervous about all this. There's a side of me that's saying it's crazy to take on a mortgage this size at this point, when my kids are getting close to college age — my parents were able to put me through college and I'd like to help my own kids as much as possible if they want to go. I'm feeling at times that we've survived so long in our current space and the smart thing to do might just be to suck it up, get this current mortgage paid off, and then have a big chunk of additional monthly income to save more aggressively to help with kids' educations, travel more, invest, and daydream about retiring early.

Alternatively, rather than getting into a new $340k+ mortgage, maybe just take out a home equity line of credit and build that 2nd story on our place. We haven't done serious research on this yet but basic inquiries suggested to me that we could do that for well under $200k, probably under $150k.

There's the neighborhood factor, too, of course. Our current spot is convenient to a lot of stuff but it's a higher-traffic street, and traffic nearby is likely to get worse as new developments are underway in the area. In the new house's location, as it's a little closer in, there isn't so much new stuff that can go in nearby. It also seems to be just a bit nicer of a neighborhood (higher owner occupancy rates/fewer poorly-maintained rentals, less traffic).

I'd love to hear some impartial opinions on this whole situation. Thanks for reading this ridiculously far.",1

About a year ago, I managed to find employment that I am able to do given my health problems, but it's not much. I clear about $500 a month or so.

t3_bz3wk2,Person to help me manage my finances,"Hello I am currently going into my Senior Year of college for Computer Science and I am horrible at budgeting. I recently went from 1000$ in my bank account a couple weeks ago, to 50$ now. I really need help learning how to budget because I feel like this will take me out in life if I don't get a handle on things. Luckily I have a job this summer and will be getting financial aid in the fall. The good news is I don't have any student debt , but I think I have 500$ in medical debt , and I used to have a credit card of 500$ debt from that , that got canceled. I was thinking about taking out a loan for a cheap used car this fall which might actually help me in the long run ( i spend a lot on food delivery and uber ), there is not a whole lot of public transportation in my area.  Is there someone out there that could help me manage my finances , where I could come up with a monthly or weekly budget  I could even pay them possibly.  Thank you",1
t3_bz3vov,"Budgeting for Student Loans, Savings, and now a car","Hello all! Thank you in advance for helping me out and for reading this post.


So as a little bit of a background about myself:
-24 years old; from Greater Boston Area
-I make $62k a year, ($3,410 monthly after putting money into my 401k).
-35k of student debt, and have brought it down by $30k since graduating with $65k last year
-I currently have $10k in savings
-I put $2,500 a month towards students loans, with the expectation to be done this year.
-I live at home, and essentially have no living expenses. My mother is a saint, and is covering my overhead so that I can pay off my loans. She will 150% be receiving a trip to an island once I’m debt free.

For the past several years, I’ve shared an old hand-me-down car with my brother. He’s younger, goes to school across the country, and is taking the car back to school with him this summer. Therefore, I am in need of a car. I don’t drive to work, I take the train. But I drive around a lot: to the gym, to my girlfriends across the state (weekly), to my friends, and my girlfriend and I do a lot of weekend trips to visit friends in bordering states. In other words, I need a car. We’ve been together for 7 years, and intend on moving in with each other (into Boston) once she’s done with Vet school next spring. With that being said she already has a car, and we would therefore have two in the city.

I know this is a little all over the place, but I really have nowhere ideal to turn, as I am being fed different advice by everyone in my life.

How much should I spend on a car? What kind of car? should I plan on leasing? If I buy, should I trade it in next year, or should we plan on having two cars? Do I take money out of saving, I’m nervous to do that because we will be engaged within the next few years and the cost of moving in somewhere will be expensive. And regardless, I should have some sort of emergency fund. 

At the core of this issue, I’m so bummed I can’t keep putting $2,500 towards loans. I was so excited to have paid it off by the end of next year. What’s a good plan so that I can still pay this loan off in a reasonable amount of time? Lastly, I’m nervous about buying a car with high mileage and something that’s old and will need a ton of repairs. 

I think I just need some help with overall clarity, as I keep looking for the downsides of every scenario.

Thanks again!",1
t3_bz3uuc,I'm confused about how to pay taxes as an independent contractor,"I have been working as an independent contractor transcriptionist for roughly 4 months now. I've been trying to figure out how to pay my taxes, and there's just so much information out there about it and the majority of it doesn't apply to me, so I have no idea what I'm actually supposed to do. I am pretty sure I have to pay quarterly, which would mean my taxes are due on the 15th. When I go to the IRS website, all the information seems irrelevant to me. I don't own my own company and I don't have any business expenses, because I don't pay for my internet as of right now. I think I might need to fill out a 1099 and a 1040, but I'm not positive about that either. When I look at these forms, a lot of the information is either irrelevant to my situation or extremely confusing, as well. And then, I also don't know if I need to fill out a separate form for state taxes or anything.

A lot of advice I've read suggests hiring an accountant, but I really don't think I should need to do that with my situation. Another thing I'm confused about is that my earnings will vary dramatically over the course of the year. I am able to work as much or as little as I want, which means that sometimes I'll make $800 a week and other times I might only make $400. I don't really understand how estimating my earnings works. If I estimate that I'll make $3,200 a month, but then only end up making $2,000 one month, what do I do? 

I'm just very confused about the whole thing and don't want to have to pay hundreds of dollars to a personal accountant when it should be easy to give the government my money.",1
t3_bz68h9,"Expecting a car insurance payout soon, would it make more sense to put that money toward our upcoming wedding and fully finance a new car?","On mobile. Sorry. Little background: my fiancée was just in a collision on the highway. It wasn’t her fault, but her car is likely totaled (waiting for a body shop to confirm). Thankfully she was mostly unhurt aside from some stiffness in her neck and shoulders. 

We’re expecting a payout of somewhere between $20-25k which is roughly what this wedding is going to end up costing all-in. We have set up a budgeting plan to save a lot of that money over the next year leading up to the wedding, but would likely end up putting several of the items on credit cards and paying them off relatively quickly. 

The question is if it would make more sense to take the lump sum of cash and put it toward the wedding since an auto loan should fetch a pretty great rate? Or take just enough of it to keep things for the wedding off credit cards? If we put the lump sum toward the wedding, we’d keep our current budget and put the extra saved money toward her auto loan. 

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Edit for a little more background since people are keen to criticize me being willing to take out a loan... her car was 2 months from being paid off and the freed up monthly income was going to more than make up for any savings I’d come up short on with the wedding. Having to buy her a new car was obviously not something we were planning for right now, but I’d rather we get her the right one that she’s comfortable in and we trust.",1

t3_bz3k28,Bank gave my personal details inc ssn to my dad.,"Throw away and typed on a phone sorry for any mistakes and poor formatting. 

There is a decent amount of money in the account. Approx 150k usd.

My grandparents used this bank for at least 3 decades. I opened an account and had my inheritance  put in there. The account manager that dealt with them also dealt with me. I get the feeling that she has a target on the balance of her accounts and my account probably makes up a big chunk of her target and she doesn't want to see any of it go. 

I live in the uk currently. Account is in the USA. and the account was inactive. I had to sign a form to reactivate . Dad sent it to me, I sent it back to my dad who hand delivered to the bank. They refused the signature, and then proceeded  to give him the account signatory card that I apparently needed to sign and come in and show id. They then gave him this form with my address account number and my ssn. Surely that's not right. What should I do? 

I completely trust my dad and he would never have any interest in stealing money or fraud etc  but what if the situation was different? In the UK there is the data protection act and that would have been a very serious offence.

To make matters worse, I did eventually  go into the bank and sign the forms etc. Now any time I try to write a check or withdraw money off my card it they lock my account even though I was just there and reactivated and told them I will be using the account.

They also give me the run around saying I need to speak to this lady who never answers my calls, rarely returns my emails and only writes that I need to call her. She cant call me back due to her phone system cant call international. I've tried to get her to set a time that she will be free for me to call to no avail.

It feels like they are trying to ignore me to keep that money there longer and longer. I'm trying to invest it and they basically wont let me. 

Do I just need to go back open an account at another bank and move all the money out? 

Do I have any possible legal recourse?

The house my father has is a multi-family home in the city, but only one section of it is habitable. His way of life was to not ever update or repair his house, and he's owned it since 1975. The rest of the house has been a very slow process of fixing for me, I've replaced the roof, and fixed some of the piping, but the entire thing needs to be renovated. Most renovation estimates I've gotten have come in at 300-400k just to get everything updated and up to code. I've spent 10-20k just on the architects, expediters, etc to try to get somewhere with it, but the city just adds more money and more work to the project at every turn. The house was built in 1930 and a lot of it is still from back then. 

I have 100k in savings and I'm not tied to the area. My girlfriend is up for moving with me anywhere I'd want to go. If I sell the house, even in the condition it's in, because of the area it's in, the appraisals have come back at around 900k. I've been talking with a financial advisor who is telling me if I want, I can just sell it and invest all of it and keep investing the returns to have a good passive income stream for the foreseeable future.

I see guys renovate buildings for profit, but I've been dealing with this for years and I'm honestly exhausted.

t3_bz331i,"Extra money, seem to have pressed all the investment buttons already","Okay, so I hope I am not treading on some much covered ground already, but in the FAQs/sidebar/community info I couldn’t find something that applies because it seems like I am on the “next step” past where most people get started.
 
Here’s the BLUF: I have extra money both from salary increases and a recent inheritance and am trying to figure out the best investment when it seems like I’m already doing most things I should be doing and I’m not sure what to do with the rest.
 
Here’s is the whole story:
My wife and I have a combined salary of about 270k. 
We have 2 kids, and 529s for both (5k contributions total each year, 2500 each). 
Home mortgage (~210k remaining at 3.15%). 
No car loans, student loans, credit cards or otherwise. 
We both contribute around the max to our respective 401ks.  (around 18k, I’ll admit I don’t try to max it down to the dollar but just be in the area without going over)
We both have Life Insurance, health insurance through work, and additional life insurance (term) outside of that. 
We have mutual fund investments through Northwestern Mutual (I’m not happy with this and looking to change, but that isn’t what the post is about, except I don’t want to put any more toward this).  We contribute about $1600/month to these. 
 
Even with all this though, I find that our budget from 5 years ago largely works for all of our expenses and that means with various raises and the like since then, we have just been gathering the excess into a savings account.  Then a family member passed and left me roughly 45k, and now I feel an urgent need to get this money working.  It’s now much more than I’d want for an emergency fund.
 
I’m just not sure what to do with it.  I thought the easy solution was to get going on a Traditional IRA with Vanguard, so I did that. But that’s capped at 6k a year and we can likely contribute more than that, not to mention the extra I currently have I’d like to put to work sooner.
 
Is the answer simple and I’m just making it more complex than it needs to be?  Should I just put more money into mutual funds and call it a day?  Or is there some other thing I should be doing?  I **think** my wife could also open an IRA and contribute 6k a year, but I’m not really sure.  Should I be doing that before or after more mutual funds if I can? One thing I am certain of is that if the answer is mutual funds, I need to do something other than what I’m currently doing and put it in no load funds (with Vanguard?) rather than managed funds with Northwestern Mutual. Are more mutual funds just the easy button to press from now on?
 
And one final question is if I do end up with an IRA between my wife and myself, with all the other investments, should I backdoor these over to Roth IRAs?  Is there ever a reason *not* to do this?",1

I met with my realtor today, and he said I could easily list it for $400,000 - $415,000, and sell for 15 to 20 over asking. ( My neighbor recently got over their asking in the same range.)

I knew this house wouldn't be my 'forever' home. It would serve as a starter home. However I've been tossing up the idea of moving outside of town, and purchasing a rural property with acreage.

The properties im looking into are in the 600,000 to 800,000 range. With 15-50 acres. 

I'm looking in, and out of the county. A lot of the properties I'm looking at are not in a very hot market. However I could see a few of them become quite desirable in the next 20 years. As cities expand. 

Basically the only way I'm going to be able to afford this is (not my idea actually). Is my parents are wanting to move in with my wife, and kids on this rural property. That being said I've been looking for properties with a good split, so we would have our own areas of the home to make it work.

If I do sell my home.

Between myself, and my parents we would be putting a hefty down payment on the home (20 to 30 percent). So that should technically bring my part of the mortgage down to about what I'm paying now.

I've tossed up the idea of keeping my current property, and renting it out. The rental market is also crazy (nobody can afford these houses anymore). But I would lose the downpayment.",1

t3_bz2wye,Considering bankruptcy and looking for a financial advisor,"I'm 28 and currently drowning in debt. 

I moved to NYC a few years ago and found the cheapest rent I could, but it was still more than I could afford on my $13/hr salary. Pretty much all of my income went toward my rent and bills. Prior to moving, I opened a few credit cards to increase my credit score and make it more likely for me to approved for an apartment even with my low income. Stupidly, I started using those cards to buy groceries and other essentials (and non essentials because it didn't fully occur to me that I was spending money I didn't have.) I fully intended to pay off my cards even though I had no realistic way to do so.

My minimum payments now are more than my monthly rent. I haven't used my credit cards for months, but paying only the monthly payment means the interest on my cards has kept accruing and they're now mostly maxed out. My credit has now take a massive hit.

I started going to school over a year ago to eventually move into a better paying field, but I'm at least a year away from graduating. It's a city school so I get aid that covers my tuition, but it means I don't have time for a second job to pay down my debt. 

I clearly cannot get out of this hole on my own. My salary has gone up a few dollars an hour but I'm still barely able to keep up with my payments. And by barely, I mean they're getting later and later while the minimum payments get bigger and bigger. I'm considering bankruptcy but the idea terrifies me and I'm ashamed that I've let it get to this point. It seems like a daunting decision and I don't want to make it lightly.

I'm hoping to speak to a professional but I don't honestly know who I would ask or where to even start. Is there someone who would be good to talk to? I looked into financial advisors but they seem to be more about buying annuities than helping people fix their fuck ups. I've looked into debt consolidation but the monthly payments on those are even more than I'm paying now on minimum payments, meaning there's no way I can afford that.

Any advice? Who should I be asking for help? Is this the kind of thing an accountant could help with? Would a bankruptcy lawyer be able to give advice on other options in case there's something better for me that I haven't thought of?

For what it's worth, my job is probably at least 80% of our total income. If I should do the worksheet and withhold extra, should we each do it on all the W4s? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1
t3_bz2u82,American Express Narrative Change/Unwarranted Collections on Credit Karma (Canadian),"Hi Guys,

Throwaway here but I've been grinding at getting my credit back together.

&amp;#x200B;

I have two questions:

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got my (closed) Amex down from $9k to $7k Canadian... it had been as high as 13k and had gone to collections.  I've been diligently putting chunks on it.  Upon receiving the payment per Kredit Carma the narrative changed to "" Bad Debt Write Off, Account Cancelled by Credit Grantor with Derogatory Rating"" - what does this mean?   The account has been closed for years and they've received steady payments for months, before it always said ""in collections/charge off.""  My rating also went slightly up when this happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I had a payday loan (I know) that wasn't repaid (I know).  I paid MoneyMart back in full after \~ 1 year.  They told me I paid them back in full.  They gave me a receipt for the payment.  There is now a company called CBV Collection Services saying I owe them $259 on behalf of Money Mart despite Money Mart saying I owe them nothing.  I asked them for written proof of the debt multiple times and they won't send anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice appreciated.",1
t3_bz2t2s,Adjusting W4 Withholding,"I recently received a Canadian PR and will be moving to Canada very soon but will continue working remotely for the company that I am currently employed at (in New York). I have done some research on the tax obligations but I am little lost on adjusting my W4 withholding.

At the beginning of the year, I changed my filing status to Married and adjusted the number of exemptions to 3 based on the IRS Withholding calculator. I am on an H-1B visa status and my wife has not held any job this year. 

Once I move to Canada, I plan on changing my W4 to withhold at the higher Single rate and also adjust the number of exemptions.  How would this affect the overall amount that I owe? When filing taxes, do I still file a joint return or file separate returns (my wife indicating 0 income)?

Any help is appreciated.

t3_bz2sx6,"Pay collections now, or in 3 months?","Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been reading this sub for the better part of 6 months or more and I appreciate all of the information I have learned. I'm working hard to build back up from prior decisions in my early 20's.

&amp;#x200B;

I have $2500 set aside as an emergency fund. This is growing monthly and will evolve and become my emergency fund + 3 months of living expenses account ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have the following credit cards:

\-$0 balance with Delta CCU (I use this for gas and misc. expenses, pay statement balance every month, low limit)

\-$0 balance with Amex (authorized user on parents account, they carry a $0 balance as well, this is new, 14.99% APR)

\-$0 balance with Chase (closed, paid off balance in full recently)

\-$1700 balance with Synchrony Bank (TJ Maxx rewards card, in collections)

&amp;#x200B;

Only other debts are my car, $4600 @ 2.25% and my mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface, I opened the TJ Maxx account about 4 or 5 years ago and after making a few payments, it looks like I just forgot about it. I received letters but didn't pay them enough attention and it's been in collections for quite some time now. 100% my fault, I own it and I am going to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation is this, I recently (6 months) started a new position and am making substantially more money. I have already paid off a few debts I had lingering (small balances) and building my emergency fund. I'm also able to invest in my companies 401k plan and start contributing to a Roth. I have had a few unexpected expenses come up in the past few months (all paid for in cash) from a $1500 car repair to veterinary services/boarding costs to normal life. My emergency fund/savings hasn't had a chance to grow like I have wanted it to.

&amp;#x200B;

We're taking a trip out of the country at the end of July, it is rather expensive between the traveling costs and different necessities that we will need while we're away. I could have paid off this collections balance had this trip not existed, however this is for my fathers 60th and a once in a life time kind of opportunity with my family. I have not gone into further debt/used a credit card nor will I for any expense of this trip.

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts are, I should wait until after we are back from this trip and things have stabilized. If I haven't had to dip into my savings for trip expenses, the plan is to pay off the balance in full immediately. If I pay it off now, I'm cutting my emergency fund/savings to a very low amount with little time to beef it back up before the trip. Since it's in collections, it's not really affecting me any less by waiting a few months to pay it off.

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be a wiser decision, due to the debt already being charged off/in collections, to not blow my emergency fund before an upcoming trip out of the country? Or, go ahead and get rid of this debt, even at the cost of lowering my emergency fund?",1
t3_bz2rgh,"raising deductible to decrease premium $200 annually, is it worth it ?","hi all. So I am on car insurance hunt. And there is AAA insurance, that offers me this: $1000 collision deductible, no glass coverage (windshield etc) for $1800 and $500 collision deductible with glass coverage for $2000. I have my savings, so I can  pay out of pocket and don't report at all if it is under $1000, but question is how worth is to be on low deductible plan if I don't use my car for commute but for pleasure mostly?

t3_bz2qyc,Help with decision between 401(k) or Stock Plan,"This is a bit of a novel, but I will try to be as succinct as possible. Here are the details:  


My company was acquired, and we were given access to a stock plan within the new company. The details of the plan are: We put in % each paycheck, and at the end of a 2-year term we have an option to buy the company's stock at a 15% discount from the price of the stock at the beginning of the stock plan. (Mid-Mayish if I recall correctly). My dumb ass didn't fully comprehend what I was reading and signed up for the maximum contribution: $416 / paycheck or $832 / month. Turns out you cannot adjust your contribution—you can only withdraw your money (exiting from the plan with no option to re-join) or place it on a one-time, 3-month pause.

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm either stuck paying $832 / month on this stock plan which *could* be a great pay-off, or *could* be just okay. Note that I can withdraw my money with no penalties so I always have that out in I need it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the other kicker: I was on this entrepreneurial kick where I really *needed* the $600 / month I was contributing to my employer's 401(k)  (sarcasm intended). So I haven't been contributing to that for about 3 months now. Finally I wised up and realized that I should probably just take my free money (100% match up to 5% of my salary), and figure out a way to make my entrepreneurial dreams come true without that investment money.

&amp;#x200B;

So the final problem is this: with my budget, I can't contribute *anything* to my 401(k) if I'm paying $832 / month to this stock plan. In fact, the rest of my budget becomes pretty tight: $20 buffer if ALL my expenses land correctly (i.e. don't overspend on gas, groceries, utilities, etc) which can be pretty hard to guarantee.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have emergency funds, back-up money, etc but the pressing question is this:

Is this stock plan worth the gamble and the increased budget-pressure or should I take my guaranteed 401(k) money + ease my budget's tension a bit? 

&amp;#x200B;

t3_bz2qmi,Roth 401k vs Traditional 401k contribution parity,"A lot of sources I’ve read have convinced me to contribute 15% of my income to my employer retirement vehicles.  As of recent, I now have the option of contributing to a Roth 401k which I plan to do.

So far my 15% has been going into a traditional 401k but it’s my understanding, that the money will be taxed in its entirety at the time of distribution.  As a result, contributing 15% to a Roth 401k would mean I’m actually contributing more into the account than the traditional

My question is what would would be % i should contribute to a Roth which would roughly equate to 15% in a traditional?

t3_bz2pln,Really in need of some advice. M (34) F (43) with no savings and 20K in debt.,"Hi guys, really appreciate any help that could be given, or some direction to do some due dilegence.

As the title says, we have no savings and are 20K in debt, about half to credit cards and half to private loans to a family member. We currently rent an apartment and would like to purchase a home in the next year or so.

Long story short, one of each of our parents had cancer, and it had its toll on us financially helping them out. We are now starting to make some steady money and seem to be in a place where we can finally start working towards bettering our future.

I would like to divide our money into the following: rent/necessary living expenses, down payment for a home, retirement, and paying off debt. What percentage of each should we be aiming for? Right now about 25% goes to rent alone. Our debt on credit cards has a few months left of no interest and no interest on the private loan. Since we have no savings and my wife is already in her 40s, I think we should prioritize retirement  (Roth IRA or 401K not sure which would be better, both self employed). Our credit isn't the greatest 650-700 range, so not sure what we would need for down payment on a house, but in our area it would probably be between 250-350k home. We own our cars already so no monthly payment on those and we aren't planning on having kids.

Any advice in regards to any direction would be really appreciated! Thanks guys!",1

t3_bz2mkw,College loan vs. 529 spending strategy advice for new freshman?,"Our eldest is starting college this fall. She received excellent, renewable merit scholarships so we are expecting to pay $25K total each year (not accounting for annual increases of course) on a sticker price of about $72K per year, including tuition, room/board, all fees, and basic expenses like books.  

We plan to pay $10K per year as our contribution; the rest will fall to our daughter's savings, earnings, and some loans.  Here's how it pencils out per the award package:

$10,000 parental contribution

$3,000 student summer earnings

$2,000 work study (academic year) earnings

$5,000 from student 529 savings (current balance is \~$21,000)

$750 subsidized Direct Loan (5.045%)

$4,250 unsubsidized Direct Loan (5.045%)

\----------

$25,000

&amp;#x200B;

My basic question is whether she should spend out her 529 in the first two years in order to avoid the unsubidized loans?  The college expects her to draw $5,000 per year from the 529 to spread it over four years, but she could use it up in two years and completely avoid borrowing until her junior year. While she'd then miss the earnings on the 529, she'd of course be avoiding the accrued loan interest and origination fees.  A third option would be to borrow only the subsidized amount each year, and use the 529 to replace the unsubsidized loans while it lasted (most of three years).

Either way she will likely leave college owing $20K, but by spending down the 529 in the first two years she'd avoid two years of interest on the unsubsidized loans. That makes sense to me, but I wanted to get another opinion before we committed to a payment plan for fall.

Note: based on our income it would have cost her about the same amount ($25K family contribution) to attend our state university and we have no concerns about her taking on modest debt ($20K) for a degree from a good private school. The school she is attending has an 88% four year graduation rate  vs. a 51% *five* year rate at the state university so it may well be cheaper in any case.",1

I have a great job which has let me coast by on not paying much attention to anything, and house ownership is sort of out of the question in my city, so I've never really put much thought into the future.

Right now, I take home about $4000 per month after Rent, Bills, etc have been paid. I have no loans or debt, and I've been keeping about $10,000 in checking, and putting anything over that into savings every month. My savings is sitting at around $80,000, and has a 2.1% interest rate so I'm getting about $120/month from that.

t3_bz2cfw,Employer sent me sketchy tax paperwork for filing. Unsure if I should dig more or if I actually got off light.,"After years of filing extensions and doing my taxes at the very last minute, this year I was proud to be able to turn them in on time. However, when my main employer from last year (I do a lot of freelancing) sent me my papers, I discovered that there was something amiss. 

I worked doing polling for this company ahead of the election for two different 4 month periods. I could've sworn I'd been forced to sign on as an independent contractor but when tax season came, they sent me a W2 with a notice of only ~$250 paid in Fed taxes and showing that I only made ~$3000 across those 8 months. That's totally absurd. Now I knew in the second period that the main project manager was fired for falsifying/not submitting pretty much any employee paperwork from the beginning of the year, but was never informed if this affected our checks.

I'm wondering what the next best thing to do is. If I was registered as an IC I obviously would prefer to not owe anything, but if instead I was an employee I damn sure want a full refund of everything taken from my checks. But I don't know how to go about solving this mystery. It could even be that I did a 1099 for the first period then did a W4 the second time around (my memory's not the best, but lesson learned: photograph everything). Or it could be that I was W4'd from the beginning and the company either pocketed the taxes from my paycheck or whathaveyou, but I would still be eligible for a full refund.

t3_bz1zp9,Employee Stock Purchase Plan,"My work holds quarterly stock purchase program where I am allowed to purchase company stock at a 15% discount of the lowest price within a period.{I think this is how it works} Below is the actual language.

&amp;#x200B;

2.       I hereby authorize payroll deductions from each paycheck from a Participating Company, as defined in the Plan, in that percentage of my total compensation (up to 10%, including base salary, commissions, overtime and/or bonuses) specified above.

  I understand that the offering period in which I have elected to participate will run for twenty-four (24) months and be divided into a series of successive purchase periods. Those purchase periods will each run for six (6) months and in successive six (6)-month periods, from the first market day of January to the last market day of June each year and from the first market day of July to the last market day of December each year. I further understand that I will be automatically enrolled, and my participation in the Plan will automatically remain in effect, from one purchase period to the next in accordance with my payroll deduction authorization, unless I withdraw from the Plan, I change the rate of my payroll deduction, or my employment status changes. I may reduce the rate of my payroll deductions during the purchase period, and I may increase my rate of payroll deductions to become effective at the beginning of any subsequent purchase period.

&amp;#x200B;

The purchase price per share will be the lower of (i) 85% of fair market value on the first market day of the offering period or (ii) 85% of fair market value on the purchase date.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is am I correct in understanding I will be purchasing stocks in 6 month periods at a reduced cost of the lowest price within that 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I am allowed to put 1 - 10 percent payroll deduction to purchase these share.

&amp;#x200B;

What is the best way to handle it. At 10% I would be contributing a little more than $1000 per 6 months or 170 per month. My salary is low to mid 100k a year. Not sure if I did my math right on those numbers. Current stock price is 52 dollars a share so I could get a good amount.

&amp;#x200B;

Whats the best way to handle this all as that may be a little steep for monthly drop in check. Will it be a smart to take the hit monthly on salary to get discounted stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

If it helps the company is a one of the top fortune 100 companies and is ranked above number 10 best places to work for last few years and I plan to be there for a long time.

t3_byvxm5,Unsure of how to proceed with our life. Need advice.,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and my husband is 29. We moved to a shitty town recently to earn more money. I just want to point out that neither of us have any education. 

We both have a full time job and should be starting to save $1000 a month, all the bills, groceries, etc is accounted for. We are also getting second part time jobs so within the next 6 months, we should be able to save anywhere from $12k to $18k. 

My dream has always been to travel the world and we were going to do that through goaheadtours. It’s a website where we make a $600 deposit and make monthly payments for 18 months and go to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for 11 days. They have around 175 tours, this is just the one we chose. That was the original plan. Along with, staying here in this town and saving up $30k to be able to move to Colorado and buy a house and just transfer from work to Colorado and continue working while going to school for veterinary. 

Now I’m not sure if we should invest in a house or if we should just travel. I’m not really sure what I want to do with my life. Sometimes I want to have a baby already but I know that if I do that then I would just be stuck here and never live out the rest of my dreams. I haven’t gone to school because there’s nothing I’m interested in besides veterinarian school and traveling so I’m not really sure how to proceed with the money we will save. 


Is it best to go travel the world or just pay off one of the cars we’re financing? I feel like I’m running out of time because I don’t have anything figured out, even though I’m only 21. Another option would be moving back home with my parents after these next 6 months, and start school there to save on rent and continue to save money without having to live in such a small town. The only thing is, my city doesn’t offer veterinarian so I would have to do something else and short term like diagnostic sonography or surgical tech. 

My husband was very keen on the idea of moving to Colorado because he wants to get into the cannabis industry and go to school to see how he can revolutionize the world by using hemp. 

I know it’s long and sort of all over the place. I’m sorry. But basically we can also transfer our jobs back to my parents’ or anywhere we choose to go. I just need some guidance on what would be the best plan. 

Thank you.",1

At the time, I was on my father's health insurance plan, and up until then he had paid my medical expenses. I paid the bill, and requested a letter from the collection agency to the credit bureaus requesting the collection be removed from my account. I still have a copy of this letter, and confirmed that it was in fact sent to each bureau (or so they say).

Fast forward to today - i am in the process of obtaining a mortgage. During lender's credit checks, i had 3 credit scores returned to me:

&amp;#x200B;

* Experian - 688
* Equifax - 757
* Transunion - 695

&amp;#x200B;

Of the three, Equifax is the only bureau that has NO records of my collection, and the others still do. Due to this, the lender is reporting my credit score as a 695 as its the ""median"" score.

Should the collection have been removed from my record, or do i have to wait the 7 years even though i have a signed letter from the collection agency requesting ""immediate deletion of any and all information reported by the collection agency""?

- Creating a US bank account and placing the money in there, I have been told I may be heavily taxed for this though.

- Sending the money to my bank account through a shop such as a Western Union, although I'm told this will cost a high fee.

- Giving a trusted US friend the cash to deposit into their own bank account and having them transfer the money to my own account.

t3_bz0av3,Thinking long term about a car,"A little back story. My car will be about a grand to fix. I owe $3946 on it as of today. I bought it for around $7k back in 2016. 2006 Nissan Altima. It runs, but the front exhaust need completely redone and probably many other problems. So I need a new car. My family growing up had problematic cars as well since we had no money. So I’m used to driving old/crappy cars. I want something that I can depend on for the next 7-10 years. 

My problem is though is what would be a smart decision. We have one child 16m old right now. We definitely want more kids. I was looking into a mini van because of the room in the inside and the sliding doors. But I want it to last me another 7-10 years so I’m looking into getting one that I actually want for a change and not just going cheap because I’m a cheap person. I want to trade in my car (trade in value $500) for the 2018 Honda Odyssey EX. The cheapest I have seen it is $26k with 45k miles. I like Honda’s because they hold their value and are made to last. Or their is the Chrysler Pacifica. Not my first choice but it’s still nice. I just hear horrible mechanical problems wrong with them BUT I can get it for $22k. It’d have the sliding doors I want and the room I care about. Just doesn’t hold its resale value at all and I’d eventually replace it with the odyssey downy the road. 

There is one more option. My husband wants an Honda accord one day. I can always get the accord now for myself and when we have a second child, get the Honda Odyssey and share the accord with my husband (Trade in his car which is nicer/newer for the odyssey). This isn’t a bad idea other than I want space in my car and I really wanted the sliding doors. 

I don’t know what to do. My husband isn’t much help because he doesn’t care and I just don’t know what would be a better investment. Spend the $26k on what I WANT and have it paid off sooner. Get what is cheaper and still good but resell it and get another one and have a longer maybe more expensive car payment. Or what I don’t really want at all but eventually get what I really want down the road and my husband gets what he wants. 

We were approved for $40k. We live in Ohio. I don’t want to spend more than $26k or less than $550 monthly. We make around $80k a year combined. We can’t put any money down as a deposit. I’d lease a odyssey if I did. 

Or I can fix my car 🤷‍♀️. But honestly, sedans with a rear facing car seat in the middle back seat and a 99th percentile baby is back breaking 😂 . It’ll be easier when he’s able to climb in it himself though! 

I want what you’d do. I don’t know “it depends on your situation.” I want what is better down the road because I have student loans to think about a year from now. (I will have $45k saved up from $55k in loans so it’s not an issue)



Edit:

Guys seriously THANK YOU. I’m leaning towards fixing my car but I have opened my mind to an older version of used car as well. I’ve gained a lot of knowledge from some of you about that. We will see depending on how much I get estimated in the final cost to fix my car. Slowly fixing it might work though. But if it’d be $2k to fix my $3900 car, sorry guys not worth it I’m buying a new one. I’m so happy I asked on here. You guys didn’t tell me what I wanted to hear and I prefer when that happens because it gets me thinking more. Again, thank you! Keep the advice coming though, they don’t teach you this stuff in college or high school. Mine anyway.",1

t3_bysf82,My credit score is rough because of my mom's debt. Do I have any way of disengaging my credit from her so that I'm not screwed after I graduate college?,"I guess my mom has opened several credit cards in my name and her's since I was around middle school age. My credit score isn't awful but it isn't good either. According to Credit Karma she currently has around $16,000 in debt across two cards. This used to be much higher and thankfully she has payed off and closed two of her credit cards, but she still misses payments sometimes. I get an email from Credit Karma every time she misses a payment. I'm just starting to get worried about how this is going to affect me and it is very frustrating that I'm going to be starting off in life with a rocky credit history. Is there any way I can distance myself from her debt, or am I screwed because technically the debt is in my name too?

Edit: after reading a few comments, I want to clarify that I believe I’m an authorized user on her account, not a co-signer or anything. I assume that taking my name off the account, as some of you suggested, will not improve my credit score but will prevent it from getting any worse and will take her debt off my report. 

I’m now researching how credit cards work so I have a bit of a better understanding. I will likely open up a new credit card solely in my own name to make small monthly purchases and immediate repayments until my credit score improves.",1

t3_bz04ei,"Future apartment changed apartment number, move in date, and increased price without our permission.","My SO and I have been panicking since yesterday as our future apartment we were really excited to move into has pulled the rug out from under us.

Our leasing agent called us saying that her coworker told her that we changed our apartment number  on our application and that she just wanted to verify our move in date. She sounded confused when we told her it was supposed to be the 28th. We were now confused so we logged into the site. There with our application was the new apartment number, and a move-in date for June 9th (THAT DAY) instead of June 28th.

When we called the ""coworker"", she stated that the apartment we applied for needed more renovations and she had talked to my SO May 11th about making these changes. We didn't even get the original agreement we wanted until May 30th. There was no way either of us were in contact with her May 11th. She also said ""You two really wanted terrace level, you two have a dog, right?"" No and no... When I tried explaining that we didn't authorize these changes she denied that possibility... She said she would look and find us something else that will work. Since then, on the site it says we are getting a similar apartment, except the move-in date is June 22, and the monthly payment of almost $200 more... Completely out of our budget.

We can deal with the slightly earlier move in date. But how can they just completely blindside us like this and change the price? We can't pay more than we originally agreed upon, and I have screenshots of the original agreement for the original price. I feel like they should have to keep their word on what we worked out May 30th. 

Am I being completely naive here by thinking this? We have been calling and they have been saying they will get it done, they just need authorization from their manager to change the price. When we asked a different person to speak to the manager we were told there isn't one. My hope that this will work out for us is pretty low at this point as we have realized how slimy these people are. Should I just pull my application completely since we really can't afford this?

Well we found a house and realized we can't afford much on the down payment side since we've been saving for a wedding and AGGRESSIVELY paying off student loans. I've been dropping 800 a month and nearly paid them off as of today. Needless to say, we can't afford our total down payment and closing costs and need assistance, even though the total mortgage with escrow included is very affordable. Its less than what our rent + wedding savings is now, so we have no worries about the payments.

We are doing a conventional loan from NY and just can't seem to scrounge up the cash in time to make the initial closing costs. Does anyone here have any idea on programs or what have you that may be able to help?

Speaking with the bank I'm lending with, they already said we make too much for any type of financial assistance from them, all they can do is give us the mortgage without any help. I know it isn't smart to go into a home with significant savings so please don't mention that here, but I thank you for worrying for me. We just need help either bringing down costs or getting assistance without going into seller concessions, our agent advised us against this since they were not in any original offer we put in.

Thank you for any help!

t3_bz021j,I want more control over my savings/bank account that is co owned by my guardian.,"I’m 16 years old but I’ve been working and saving up for the past 2 ish years now. All of the money I have made is in some sort of account my mom set up and she doesn’t let me spend any of the money because she wanted to wait until I turn 17 and also to gain interest; I really hate this and never agreed to it. Anyways, I am aware that as a minor in the US, I have to have a parent co-owning the bank account. Does that still apply when I turn 18 ( does she still co own it even when I turn 18 or does she immediately go away or something lol)? What about if it’s an account at a different bank than my mom uses? Would she have to create an account at that bank..?

t3_byzvgj,I want to continue school but I'm not sure I can afford it,"So, a little about myself: I did fairly well in high school, averaging a 3.7 GPA along with a few dual-enrollment classes (totalling around 12-15 hours of credit) and got a 30 on my ACT. Now, this allowed me to (quite easily I might say) get into the college that I was looking at. I got offered some decent scholarships, along with a federal grant as my EFC was fairly low (at the time of applying, my dad was working and bringing in around $50k and my mom making a few K for a family of 6). That has changed, recently, but more about that later.

So, I started off university by studying business. I thought I wanted to be a business owner/entrepreneur, so I took some business classes. I did very poorly. It was a mix of boredom, lack of self-discipline, and just an utter mess. I have no excuses except for laziness. This led to me getting below a 2.0 GPA (very shit, yea yea) and put on Academic Probation at my university. Going into second semester, I was going to try harder, but again my laziness got the best of me and I did very poorly... again. This landed me on my last chance of Academic Probation with the university.

I decided to switch majors as I realized business wasn't for me. I'm currently dipping my toe into Pre-Med (quite the switch, I know haha). To catch up, I'm taking a summer class. It just started today as of posting this thread. But as I was perusing my university's informational site, I noticed I owed $1200, due in 2 days. I obviously can't pay that (I have about $2 in my checkings and savings. I never learned to budget and manage my money...) With my school performance being absolute ass the last year too, I had a few of my scholarships revoked, obviously. But I really want to continue with school, despite my poor performance last year. Over the last few weeks and summer in general, I've been focusing on becoming a better person; managing my time, money (or lack thereof), and being more disciplined, and I'm really excited to tackle this school year. My mother also got a new job, so now my family makes a lot more money and it's harder to get federal grants and such as my family is seen as ""less poor.""

tl;dr - almost failing out of school, lost my scholarships and can't really afford to take classes but I really want to.

So my question(s) is pretty simple: how can I continue school? What can I do to be able to afford classes and continuing with my education?",1
t3_byzr1r,"Need financial advise on sources of legitimate loan consolidation methods, etc","I am currently looking at refinancing my parents house so they don't lose it.  This is going to put me in a rough spot, but I also don't want to see my parents homeless.  They have been there for me in the past and while I don't feel I owe them this, it is part of my personality to try and make things work out at least marginally better than awful when bad situations arise.

I will be refinancing my car payments into the house payments, and will be looking at roughly $950 a month on the Mortgage (this will include paying off back taxes and money owed as well as the car payments.)  Losing the $400 car payment a month will aid in this.

However, I would like to take my college loans that had gone into default and refinance them into a legitimate consolidation program.  While the loans have gone into default, I am making monthly payments on all of them, but a few of them have gone from $80 a month to $180 as of this last year, and I'm afraid the graduated payments are outpacing my yearly raises.

If it helps, I live in NY and work as a Civil Service employee.  Any good programs out there that would assist me in any of this?

PNC card $1,500 limit 

\*both cards were opened in college to ""build my credit""\*

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be in my best interest to open a new Southwest card?   
Should I just attach my name to my wife's current credit card account?

Is there another card that you would recommend?

t3_byzkzs,What percent for my 401(k) contribution?,Hey guys. I am starting a new job in a couple days and my employer matches 25% or the first 6%.

I want to take full advantage of the match however also do not want to over contribute right now so I can work on tackling my student loans. Would the ideal amount be 1.5%? (6% *.25). Thanks!,1

t3_byzg8z,Beginner looking for help with retirement savings / IRA accounts,"Very new to savings and investments and looking for some advice regarding saving for the future. I (24) opened a Roth  IRA with my bank (Citizens bank) a number of years ago to get my foot in the door of retirement savings. Currently I have approx. $5,000 invested in this account. I recently started to work full time as a contractor for a company at $17 per hour which could transition into full time at a slightly higher pay rate with benefits including a 401k match. 

My issue is that the rate on my IRA is incredibly low (.75%). I have done retirement calculators that say even if I max this account out every year until I’m 70 I still will not see any sort of significant return. Are there IRA accounts out there that have higher interest rates I should be investing in? Also, would I be able to roll the money currently invested in this account over to another account without a penalty?

t3_byz725,Buying land on the water in Europe.,"Hey there!  
So I've been a long time vagabond (my financial skills are far below zero), however, when I first moved to Denmark my parents who come from some money have bought me an apartment. They said if I ever wanted to sell that apartment, which I rent out, the money could be used towards a new place to live. I have been a long time living in various communes and recently have started my own collective with about 20 of my friends where we live on boats and live a sailing/vagabond lifestyle.   
We all are based in Europe. If I flip this apartment I think I can expect to raise around 100,000 euros, as real estate in Copenhagen has skyrocketed. I was wondering about buying a plot of land by the water in Europe.   


How would I go about doing that? What risks should I be aware of? What can I expect to pay and where should I look?  


All we want is a small plot of land at the edge of the water where we can build our own harbor and have a permaculture farm. I would really appreciate any help you guys can give me!  
Also, if there is another subreddit I should be aware of where I can ask for this kind of advice, please let me know.   


Thanks a lot and good wind!",1
t3_byz6oj,Can I pay off a HELOC with some other loan?,"We want to sell our house but we have a stupid HELOC. We originally got the HELOC ($15k) in June '17 to do some kitchen renovations (to make it more attractive to buyers) as well as to consolidate our credit card debt. Then one of our trees needed to be removed since half of it fell down. Then we geniuses had the brilliant idea of using it to make a down payment on a new-ish car. Then our dog needed stupid expensive surgery. And then another surgery. And then another tree needed to go. Haven't even touched the damn kitchen.

&amp;#x200B;

We now owe\~$17.5k on the HELOC (APR is 5% by the way). Can't afford to pay more than $300/month, and most months we can't even pay that. We want to get out of this house but as I understand it, we can't until we pay off the HELOC because it's considered a lien on our house. A HELOC payoff calculator tells me that at this rate, it'll take about 5 1/2 years to pay it off. Don't wanna get into detail but basically I can't wait that long.

&amp;#x200B;

So: Can we pay off the HELOC by getting some other loan that doesn't prevent us from selling our house? It seems like a stupid question but paying off the HELOC has been plaguing me for ages and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of this sooner, so I get the feeling it's too good to be true. I'm guessing we'd have a significantly higher APR or something.",1
t3_byz6dj,Question/Assistance with Wife's Student Loans,"Thank you all in advance

I will try to keep this short. My wife's parents signed her up for college about 9 maybe 10 years ago. They said they'd pay for everything. They haven't paid a dime. My wife was molested about 5 or 6 months into college and she decided not to go back.

As you can imagine mistakes were made but young people make mistakes (not dismissing her trauma). The problem is she is constantly hounded by people trying to get money out of her. She works part time and so far her wages have not been garnished. What is the best course of action? Her mom is 100% white and her dad is 50% Mexican and 50% Indian (not 100% on the tribe) if that helps. Maybe there is some sort of minority assistance available? I know I'm grasping at straws but I'm trying to bring up any information that may be helpful.

She is not sure how much is owed but it is 9k-12k. Is ignoring the debt collectors the right way to go? Does she start a payment plan? Is there a way to get it reduced or completely voided?

Thank you all again.",1

t3_byyzac,Thinking of Renting .. What can I afford?," 

 I've lived with my sister for the last 4 years and have paid a very low rent. I'm hoping to be able to move out soon because I need independence. The place I'm looking at is in a really great, central location. It would be my first ""adult"" apartment that was really my own. But it's $1,000 a month.

I put 36% into my savings - 401k and ""others"" savings account (emergencies/future house/possible travel, etc.) approx. $1,100 a month goes into my savings.

Including insurance, paying back a loan, parking, utilities, groceries, gas, pets, etc = $1,800 a month approximately are my ""needs"" expenses.

That would leave me with approximately $380 a month left over for going out, having fun, etc.

So my question is, for anyone in a similar position (that rented something maybe a little bit above what they should spend) is it worth it? I'm used to pretty much being able to buy whatever because my monthly expenses are so low. But I think this would be great practice for the real world and really watching what I spend/being more purposeful about what I buy. I wouldn't be spending MORE money each month, just spending my money differently. Am I being too ambitious? Is this amount of rent careless? Thoughts?",1

She is refusing to pay it as well, as she's ""penniless"" (she's currently living with my older brother as she's dealing with some mental health problems.) My dad is saying, ""Fuck it. I'm getting my own phone line. Every man for himself.""

This essentially leaves me, my younger brother, and my mother to fend for ourselves.

3.) Why the fuck aren't we taught how to handle phone lines in High School?

t3_byysr6,Would a car loan build credit? Should I still get a credit card if I get a loan?,"I'm 22. I have 2k in savings right now. I make a little over 1k a month, was blowing through my money like crazy until a few months ago. I've been saving 500 a month since I got my shit together and learned to budget properly. My necessary expenses are about 200 a month, and I got a raise last week so I should be making about 1200 a month from now on. 

My car broke down this weekend and it's being looked at today, but it might cost more to fix than the $900 I've paid for it. I only had it for 2 months, it's my first car and if I had the mechanical knowledge I have now I most likely wouldn't have bought it.

I found a hearse for sale, owning a hearse has always been one of my dreams, albeit one I expected to achieve way later in life. It's $3900, 101k miles but just retired from a funeral home, so likely well-maintained. It's across the country, but the company regularly ships cars to auctions near me so I'd be able to have it sent with one of those shipments for a discounted rate. I plan on having a mechanic near there inspect it before I make a decision, but if it's all good I'd absolutely love to buy it.

I have absolutely no credit history, and had been considering opening a credit card and use it for my expenses to be paid off each month and build credit. I'm considering taking out a loan to buy this car instead, this will also build up my credit, right? If I do that, should I still get a credit card? 

I'm going to a local credit union today to discuss my options with them, is it likely they'll give me a loan with no history? I don't really know how loans work but I've been reading about them, I'd like to put about $800 down and keep my monthly payments at $250 or less, would that be reasonable? I'll be spending about $400 at the vet this week and don't want to blow through all my savings at once, but this car is something I want very badly. I just don't want to let my fantasies cloud my judgment, so I'm asking here. I know I'll be able to rebuild my savings very quickly, and I'll be more than motivated to save even more.",1

I'm set on at least the fireplace but the cheapest of these usually lies in the $1100 range. I just don't know if this is overspending my money - I'm putting about 10% of my budget into investments, 10% into a 401k, and 15% into an emergency fund until I hit approx 6 months of expenses, which will be about a year from now where I'll probably decide if I want to move to a different job.

t3_bykx1f,saving up for a house and my dad offered me 100k from his money market if i just pay him the 3% interest monthly he would’ve earned.,"this is a little personal finance and a little homebuying, so apologies if in the wrong space.

i’m in the beginning stages of saving up for a house.  my dad told me last night that he’s been thinking about this for months and offered to give me $100k from his investments that he’s currently earning 3% interest on.  all he wants me to do is send him what he would’ve gained in interest each month.  (could he be earning more:  he’s a bit older (65) and has pulled his money out of the stock market for the most part and doesn’t feel comfortable going back.)

the $100k would have eventually been left in a will and my dad was planning just to pull interest from it each month for the rest of his life, about $3k a year.

we’re looking at houses between 300-400k and this would essentially pay for a 20% down payment plus closing costs keeping us out of having to pay PMI.

i guess i’m still a little overwhelmed at the offer.  my dad wholeheartedly wants to, as he said his parents helped him buy his first house and he wants to do the same.  

overall, paying $250 a month to him for whatever the rest of his life is seems like a great deal, essentially buying $100k at a great discount.

i can’t quite see a downside, but was hoping to post here in case i might be missing something.  i’ve just never had this kind of help before.  is this a good idea overall?

tldr: my dad offered me 100k for help with buying a house if i pay him the 3% interest ($250) he would’ve made on it monthly for the next 20-25 years.

edit: ty all for your comments.  they are unbelievably helpful and i really appreciate them.",1

I was also told that buying a car with a loan and paying this off will help solidify my credit score. While this makes sense, is it actually necessary? Let’s say I have a score of 800: does how I got that score have any impact on what kind of mortgage interest rates I could get?

t3_byxvpv,Account that I had closed is actually still open and acured over $140 in overdraft charges. Help!,"Hi, back in March I finally decided that my current credit union was charging me way to much in fees, moved to a different bank, and closed the account. However that last step never actually happened.

Backstory time! It's not technically necessary but it helps explain a lot. You can skip to the bottom of you don't like walls of text.

I had called over the phone to close the account and after all the retainer garbage the woman said the account would be closed. I drained my accounts into my new bank and went on my merry way. I thought everything was fine, I had stopped getting balance notifications every Friday and had shredded my card and checks.

Last Friday I get a email from the community college I attended and they explained that there had been an error in applying my grants and one was left out so it would be paid out ASAP to the old account. Now since it's summer I wasn't actively monitoring my email so I didn't see this email until Sunday night and during the summer financial aid doesn't open until 11am Monday. I figured I would go to financial aid and explain what happened since the account was closed and the money would probably bounce back to the college.

Then the unexpected happened. I got a text from my old bank letting me know that there was a large deposit into my account of the amount from the college minus $139.95 they had charged me for overdraft fees. 2 weeks after the account was supposed to be closed an old $10 subscription tried to draw money which caused the account to go negative and continue to accrue low balance fees up to some kind of cap. 

Now the thing is I never got and letters, phone calls, or texts telling me my account was both overdrawn and still open.

Skip to here

Ok so I'm basically out $120 dollars because my old credit union failed to close my account and my college failed to update my info in their legacy system. What can I do to prove that I previously tried to close the account and get that $120 back. They have outsourced their call center so I doubt the person who ""closed"" the account is still there and the nearest branch is ~35 miles away.",1

I’m currently trying to assist my parents in their financial situation, credit card debit wise, and would like some advice. There are a few accounts open with high balances with up to 101% utilization on some cards. With that being said, is it better for their credit score if we pay the CARD with the highest utilization? Or is the score itself more relied on the overall credit utilization rather than an individual card? I am planning to employ the snowball method to help them out. I feel like that method would be best since at the end of the day, this is all a mental game as well and I want them to see progress and keep them motivated that way to get rid of all of this bad debt. If we were to pay off the higher utilization card, it would take care of one card fully but if I spread out that same amount of money, I can tackle down three different cards completely, giving them a better feeling.

t3_bypc5b,"Starting PhD, how to manage excess cash?","I'm at the start of a PhD program in a high cost of living (CoL) city. I am doing paid work for the university this summer at a rate sufficient to pay the bills until the program officially starts in the fall. I am guaranteed funding for the first 12 months, and will be applying to secure funding for the rest of it in October through the NSF.

I've lived in this area for several years already, so I have a good handle on monthly expenses. Beginning in September, I'll be earning about $2200-2300/month post-taxes (33k annual stipend). Housing costs (I'm renting) will be $1050-1100/month depending on utilities, and other expenses are in the $500-600/month range. I'm not asking for how to balance a budget -- for the HCoL place that it is ($8/beer) I manage to live within my means. As a 23yo, I fortunately don't have a lot of ""adult"" expenses yet. So net monthly outflow should not top $1700.

The question is, what should I do with my accumulating cash? I currently have about $8000 saved up sitting in a high-yield savings account (2.1%). I have secured funding for the next full 12 months, and will hopefully secure the rest of my 3-4 years in the next 6 months. My advisor has been at the university for 3 years, has already graduated 2 students through his previous appointment, and the lab is very well funded. So things are looking pretty stable.

I already have my ""emergency fund"" stocked at this point with my residual from past employment. So what should my next step be? Roth IRA, index funds, CDs, etc.? I'm leaning towards more liquid assets, since my earnings potential over the next four years is not too great, and will need capital when I finish my degree and find a place to settle. At the same time, keeping the money in a savings account feels like a silly waste given the horizon is relatively long (\~4 years).

t3_byu06i,Car buying help for college student? (How to afford a down payment on a car with summer jobs),"(If this post is in the wrong place please let me know where to post it. I checked Ask Reddit and it has to be generic.)



I'm a college student going into my sophomore year and currently in the market for a new car. The drive is about 160 miles (about 1 hour 20 min) and I'm looking at a used 2007-2015 Honda Fit due to the high reviews for a college student and the amount of storage space. The problem is that I have had trouble saving in the past and didn't work this whole freshman year, which caused my savings to go down the drain.

I'm currently working as a cashier at a grocery store in walking distance. So far I have been splitting my paychecks into savings checking, and paying off my remaining (less than $200). Once I pay off my credit card I have to also start paying off money I owe to my parents from some college expenses. I will then have another summer camp job starting at the end of this month when schools get out, but it's just out of range to walk.

The main purpose for the car would be to drive to both of my jobs, then be able to drive to school and occasionally come home on a weekend. I'd use it to commute to a job should I get one off campus as well. My current situation in school is taking an Lyft to the train station ($25+), riding the train ($16) and then being picked up, but I feel like my money would be better spent on gas, and that way I could also take as much as I would need instead of hauling everything.

The summer camp job is 8-12 and sometimes I'm scheduled at 12:30 at my cashier job which would mean I couldn't walk there in time. The money I'm currently making a month at the grocery store gives me more than enough for a monthly payment (hopefully around $150), and then I will make sure I get a job at school. The problem is that I can't afford a down payment. Based on how I need to split my checks right now it seems like I'll only be getting enough if I save every single penny and it would be at the end of the summer. I'm trying to convince my parents to help with the initial payment plus any dealer fees and taxes (with me agreeing to pay the monthly payments as well as the parking permit and gas), but because they're both teachers and wouldn't be making money in the summer it's hard to get them to help since they have to save their own money for the break. They said maybe at the end of the summer and I have to show I'm responsible, but I'm somewhat impatient and trying to figure out how to make up the money now before the camp job starts. I don't really have any other outside resources right now on how to make the first payment.

Edit: my parents said if I were to get a car I don't have to factor insurance into the cost yet. But I'm not even sure what else the fees and interest of financing are yet

&amp;#x200B;

I was with Talk-Talk i'd say about 5 years ago, paid for the Internet and a Landline (Required for internet access). When I left the property I had to cancel my contract and after paying the leaving fee I had about 3 months of constant letters asking for repayments on the 'Outstanding debt'.

&amp;#x200B;

I contacted the company multiple times, was passed from pillar to post and eventually was put in touch with a complaints manager who, despite being incredibly rude and short with me, advised me to disregard the letters as the debt had already been paid and appeared to be an admit issue.

&amp;#x200B;

After this was 'resolved' I didn't receive any correspondence from them for a good while, I believe maybe 6 months down the line I started getting emails about '£130 outstanding debt' I contacted them again and was advised they had no record of this as the account was completely paid off at the time of closure.

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely appalling company, and after that I hadn't heard from them in about 3 years. In the last few months i've been getting calls and texts from unknown companies/parties asking to call them on premium numbers, addressing me by my surname. Eventually one said it was on behalf of  Talk-Talk and that they were responsible for retrieving this 'debt'.

I received a text message this morning from MoriartyLaw (Basically a debt collector under a different name) asking me to call their premium number, after some research I noted this is directly linked to Talk-Talk.

The thing is, there is no debt. Any outstanding balance was paid in full many years ago and there was nothing outstanding. I received verbal confirmation from TalkTalk on no less that 3 separate occasions and I wonder where I stand currently from a legal perspective. They do not have access to my address and I believe the only information they have to identify me is this phone number, I would prefer this not to go to a CCJ but I am in no way shape or form going to pay additional money for a non-existent debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my concerns are in regards to a debt collection. About a year or so ago, I saw a dermatologist and got a steroid shot. That steroid shot cost $150 (I am in medicine, and gosh they rip everyone off. The medicine system is broken). Anyways, I never paid it. I was in the process of a move and overlooked it. So I know I owe that much. I got mail from the collections agency in May 20, 2019 with the notice of debt owed and account information. They are asking for $157.96 (which sounds about right, and I know I owe that much). After reading the lengthy information about collections on this subreddit, I called them. I recorded the convo after letting them know I will be recording, and discussed the debt. She said as long as I pay the debt, nothing will go on my credit. She also said she doesn't know anything about a ""pay for delete"". What she said is that once the due is paid, the creditors (who is the dermatology center) will be notified and nothing else will happen and nothing will be reported to the credit bureaus.

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, here is my plan of attack next. I read that it is very important to send a debt validation letter, which I will do via certified Mail, return receipt requested . Once that is done, I will wait for the debt validation from them and pay it thereafter with a check.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I feel like I am totally missing something here. Maybe it is a lapse in my understanding of debt collections. If a debt collection is paid, is everything over and nothing will go on my credit? Is ""pay for delete"" for when a debt is listed already in your credit? She kept telling me she doesn't know what a pay for delete is and by paying, everything will be taken care of. Am I missing something here? Please feel free to give any additional advice in this process.

This debt is seriously crippling that I've considered bankruptcy but that would put an end to our housing dreams for many years to come. Furthermore, we both have student loans to pay as well (IBR plan already). Realistically, due to our professions it would be difficult to get a steady second job as well. Our vehicle is underwater by about 5k, so we can't sell or trade it in without losing a ton. We still have a contract with our cell phone provider, so we can't drop that any time soon. We also have a habit of eating out all of the time, so we don't have a food budget it just seems to be a free-for-all at times.

Our budget is the following:

**Income (combined/after taxes&amp;deductions):** $4,876/month (not including the two extra paychecks per year each)

**Monthly Debt:** 

Rent - $1114/month

Gas/Electric -  $175-200/month-ish give or take

Vehicle - $392/month

Insurance - $150/month

Gas - $120-150/month avg

Cats - $30-50/month avg for food/litter

Student Loans (combined) - $455/month

Cell Phone Plan - $160/month

Cable/Internet - $160/month

Netflix - $11/month

iTunes Music (Fiance INSISTS) - $11/month

Gym - $22/month

Food - $400-500/month????

Misc/Entertainment - $100/month?

Credit Card #1 - 9.9%, $19,750 total, $394 min payment

Credit Card #2 - 13.24%, $8,200 total, $180 min payment

Credit Card #3 - 13.24%, $2,000 total, $50 min payment

Credit Card #4 - 22% (OUCH) $1,675 total, $50 min payment


I can see some improvements as I can cancel cable and cut that bill in half, and cut our food budget down, but otherwise I just see these large debt numbers and I become paralyzed and don't know where to start. I suppose start paying off the highest interest rate first which would be Credit Card #4. I was offered a Flex Pay option on Card #2 which I would be able to roll the balance of #3 and #4 into it at a 9.9% APR, but 3 year term and it'll add $130/month to our expenses. With the APR it is a no brainer, but I don't feel comfortable adding a $130/month expense. I tried applying for a loan consolidation/lower interest, but was turned down as they would only consider my income and not both of ours. Otherwise, I feel like we have more than enough money to live but with so much debt we are **not thriving** as I think we should be. It doesn't help that my fiance and I are currently living apart. I accepted a role in a new part of town about an hour away and I am living with my father temporarily until my fiance can find a new job here (she has a contract and is stuck there for about 4 more months). My dad does not charge me rent/utilities, but we are still on the hook for the other apartment obviously. In the mean time, we commute every weekend to see each other--I see her one weekend, and the other she comes to me. The expense for these trips add to our gas monthly average by about $100/month but since it is temporary I haven't considered it in the budget at this time. Can anyone offer some advice? Comments? Constructive Criticism?

t3_bysi8c,Partner at a small accounting firm reached to me to take over his firm in 2-3 years.,"Hello everyone.


I’m a CPA for about 7 years now. I did 5 in public accounting at a medium sized firm (tax, audit and counseling), then switched for a financial analyst position in an international company. Oh and I just turned 30.

I left my initial firm job because I was getting the biggest clients and they were all exhausting audits. I loved personal tax, company tax, compilation and reviews. The boring audit work wasn’t there and I was closer to the clients. With audits, it was the firm’s partners who counseled the clients.

Two summers ago I has enough and applied for a financial analyst position at a publicly traded company. Holy crap are the conditions good. 35-40 hr workweeks (no more 60-70), about 50% better compensation and a whole month of paid vacation.

My personal quality of life improved significantly. Plus both jobs are in the same city, meaning the compensation increase becomes all supplemental available revenue.

I’m definitely comfortable where I am and I could easily stay for life. I could stay analyst all my life to keep stress low (but pay then pretty much only follows inflation) or I could battle for a manager and higher job, but stress and workload would increase. The choice will always be there.

However, I do miss counseling different clients from the region. It was definitely fun seeing different companies grow and help their owners take important decisions.

This partner that reached out is a good family friend and my grandmother had a great relationship with his own mother. He’s the sole partner in an about 7-10 employee sized firm. He seems to have a solid, regular clientele.

I’m actually in a deep process of thinking. I’m meeting the partner soon again for lunch and will ask for financials.

I’m definitely not 100% comfortable with all of this at this very moment, because I’m fine where I am, but I see this as a once in a lifetime chance. Very high risk, very high reward.

Here is where I’m reaching out to you guys, any opinions?

Thanks for reading.",1
t3_bysf19,"Pick apart my plan: rent indefinitely, invest cost of property taxes instead of buy a house","My boyfriend and I were talking about our plans for the future, where we might like to buy a house, etc. We looked at the cost of property taxes in a few areas we’d consider living and I guess we’re naive, but I was surprised at how high they were. The low end is $4,000.

We currently rent in a neighborhood we love. We can’t afford to buy here, but we have a great situation with a beautiful apartment and great landlords. I was thinking, what if we just rent forever and invest what we would have paid in property taxes in the market? We’ll eventually need to rent a bigger house when we decide to have kids, but would still be able to invest pretty generously. Our investment would grow, our housing costs would be fixed, we’d never have to worry about replacing a roof, etc. 

We’re currently saving for a down payment. Say we put $30,000 in the market instead and contributed $400/month to it (a little more than we’d pay monthly for property taxes in one of the ‘less expensive’ neighborhoods we’ve looked at). At a 7% rate of return, we could expect our investment to be worth over $700,000 in 30 years (this would be in addition to our retirement savings). That’s got to be as valuable, if not more, than owning a house, right? 

Surely this plan is flawed since I don’t know a single person who has gone this route, haha. So what’s the downside of our idea? Obviously I know the market is unpredictable, but so is the housing market. 

This is not actually our plan, just an idea we were tossing around tonight, but in my head it seems like a good enough idea and I’m wondering what I’m missing.",1

t3_byt7xs,I need help. should I use bank or credit union if I'm using the account for temporary ( or maybe long term I don't know)?,"I need somewhere to put my money fast because I recently got a job and they only do direct deposit (also manager sounded like they really wanted me to open an account since a check is coming in for me soon) and I don't know if I should put my money in a bank or credit union. I'm debating about these two options. if you can help me decide that would be great. When I read through the websites the features sound about the same.  (Background I'm 17 years old (probably can't open a bank/credit union account, but I'm going to try and tell them my background story like I am now) and my mom is out of town now and I recently got a job for the summer. She told me to get a temporary checking to account bank account (anywhere else, but chase) until she gets back because her bank (chase) is offering her $350 if she refers someone in if I get a checkings and savings account through them. However, I might keep that temporary bank/credit union account ( I keep on hearing that big banks are bad and I should go with a smaller bank/credit union)

Option one:

Option two (kind of a big bank, but all the features and interest rates seem nice and ratings are good compared to the chase I think):

option there (hell):

go to one other the ""big banks"" such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, etc. I heard these companies are bad.

t3_bytzvh,Weighing my options for a vehicle purchase in a year of change.,"I am considering replacing my 2010 Mazda 6.  It has been a fantastic car and has zero problems with it, and currently has 114k miles on it. I typically favor replacing my vehicle right around the 100k mark to avoid having to deal with any substantial maintenance work on them.  Our other vehicle is a 2015 Mazda CX-5 with 45k miles on it, which will be paid off next month.

I was holding off until we found out if we were going to be able to expand our family, and in fantastic news, we found out we have another little one on the way this year!  There have been quite a few things waiting on which way this was going to go, so now we are considering not only replacing my car, but also moving to a slightly larger house, while also taking on the extra commitment of additional childcare expense.  The good news is our older child will hit kindergarten next year and so we'll have almost no overlap in expensive daycare.  After accounting for a move into a slightly larger house and accounting for daycare expenses, we will have about $2,900 unaccounted for in our budget each month. We want to focus on more savings soon, since until recently all this money was getting dumped into student loans, which we finally paid off!  We've still been contributing to our 401k's and whatnot, but feel we could be doing better.

I am going back and forth on whether we need access to a vehicle larger than the CX-5.  I have already confirmed two car seats fits just fine in the Mazda 6, so really the only places we have an issue are if we went on an extended car trip or took a big beach trip vacation, which will likely happen a few times a year. By the time we are worrying about the kids wanting to bring friends along to places, we'll be ready to replace the CX-5 and could get a van or 3row SUV at that time.

I have about $10k allocated for a down payment, and should hopefully get about $3k more from selling the current Mazda 6. 

Some options I am considering:  

Get a lightly used Mazda 6 again, since I've loved the car and they've only gotten better.  I can get one with less than 10k miles for right around $27k, which means financing in the neighborhood of $16k at 4% for five years for $289/mo.  (likely pay off early, but our goal is keep our monthly commitments down to be on the safe side)

Going big so we have tons and tons of space to haul around baby stuff and go camping/road trips, etc.  I'd likely get a lightly used Chevy Traverse, which runs right around $35k for the trim I'd pick with 10k miles or so.  With the same down payment, I'd be financing about $24k, which equates to $445/mo.

Keep the current car and just expect to drop some money soon on maintenance.  I've always done the usual maintenance of tires, brakes, oil changes, wipers, but nothing other than that except a muffler gasket repair about four years ago.  I really like all the new safety features in the new models, so while this is definitely the most frugal option, my combination of *wanting* a new shiny toy combined with the thought that the new car will be safer are making this a hard choice to consider.

Looking for some thoughts on this hot mess of a year I'm diving into, thanks!",1
t3_byksrq,Please take time to understand your health insurance coverage,"After reading the post about understanding your workplace benifits I thought people should think about this as well.

The catalyst for me to do more research was when a coworker's daughter became pregnant.  Everyone talks about how great the provision of the ACA that allows adult children to stay on their parents insurance is. Well maybe not so much at least if you have female adult children. Come to find out most insurance companies do not cover any pregnancy related expenses for dependents on their parents insurance. This came as a huge shock to my coworker and myself as well. 

Something else most insurance companies usually don't let customers know is that if you can't find an in network doctor or specialist within a reasonable distance you can file for a waiver to get the insurance to cover an out of network doctor at in network rates.

t3_byyol9,Best Checking Accounts with more modern views?,"EDIT: Guess this is the wrong sub to get actual modern advice to finances. Thanks to the two people who gave me actual checking account advice. Just because I think that I should get my money when it's been sent, doesn't mean I am a poor financial planner. On the contrary, I have a nice emergency fund, a fat 401K, plenty of extra money for fun stuff and an IRA that is doing nice. Get over yourselves that some people like different features and don't like getting screwed over by their banks. Funny thing is, I would bet over the next few years, more banks will be on board about posting direct deposits when they get them, and you guys will still be as irrelevant as ever.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: OMG get off the paycheck 2 days early thing. I am fine, I don't live paycheck to paycheck. I WANT MODERN BANKING and the getting your paycheck two days early and not just sitting in a holding account being used for the benefit of the bank only is FINE and doesn't reflect on my financial status. Sheesh!

&amp;#x200B;

After yet another issue with our current bank, we are considering leaving them and moving to a bank with more modern views on how to do business. I just don't know where to start looking and what banks would fit my banking ""wish list"", so I would love to have some suggestions on what personalfinance uses that hit's on that list.

So here is what I would love to get out of a checking account

1. Online web features are robust and let me bank quickly and easily - Current bank does have this and I don't want to have to give up my online features
2. I want to get paid up to 2 days early!! - Why does my bank not have this already, I don't know, but this is probably one of my #1 complaints with them. I literally have a small local checking account only for my car payment and they have it, so why doesn't my big bank have this!
3. Promotional start up reward - This isn't a deal breaker, but it would be nice.
4. Great customer service - Chat, text, calling, I just want to get a fast, friendly service with no run around.
5. No fees! None, zero, zip. I have direct deposit so the fees need to be waived for direct deposits.
6. Online only is OK as long as they have great ATM policies (fee reimbursement, big nationwide network, maybe even be able to deposit cash)

I already have Ally, a small local bank just for my car payment, and a big localish bank that has nickeled/dimed me for the last time.

Ally I do really like, but they don't offer my paycheck up to 2 days early. I know they get it 2 days early because my small local auto debit bank does, they just don't credit it until actual payday. Small local bank is bare bones with no frills and their online banking makes me sad, would not move to them. Big localish bank has yet again given me a fee for something stupid. They want $8 for a new debit card rather than a 10 year relationship. No credit unions... we have two local ones but they are so antiquated I would not want to have a checking account with them, even though we are planning on putting a chunk of savings with them.

It's time for a change, I just don't know what to really consider!",1
t3_bytnc2,Should I switch my brokerage savings to buy a duplex?,"So here's my situation:

I am a 22 year old with a healthy stockpile of savings, a roth IRA, and an excellent retirement plan with my employer. My salary is not great ($14.5/h ), but I have a stable career in higher education admin with good benefits no matter what. I plan to go to grad school in the next couple of years to try and break into the faculty side of the academy. I live in Montana for context.

I am currently paying about $600/m in rent, plus another $80-$120 in utilities (gas, electric, and internet). Rent/utilities are by FAR my largest expenses. A duplex has been listed for sale right near my current place for nearly a year, and is listed for $170,000. (Price was dropped from $190 to $170 in April). My lease expires in August, and I was thinking it might be worth making a switch and buying instead of renting.

I figure that a mortgage on this house would range from anywhere between $800-$1200/m, but have not yet run these hard numbers. (I have just used online estimators/calcs). I also think that I could rent half of the property for anywhere between $500-$600/m to cover a great deal of that, and when I move out for grad school I could get both sides rented for net neutral or positive.

My parents are also interested in possibly helping out with the downpayment and owning the home together, though I could contribute nearly 20% as a downpayment on my own. I certainly could get a good chunk if the asking price goes down below its current $170k. The catch with that would be that I currently have a good portion of my savings (\~70%) tied up in a brokerage account. I could withdraw that at a net-gain (since I first invested it) for the downpayment, but I am not sure if it's worth it. I'd plan to own the home more-or-less indefinitely and just continue to rent it out whenever I am not living there.

The net neutral or even positive on the mortgage compared to rent sound really enticing, but I am not certain if everything pencils out. **Is this even worth exploring in more detail**?

My next steps are: tour the property and look at the state of things; look into financing options; draw up the math to see if I could go even/positive on the deal; continue on from there.

What am I missing? Any advice or things to look out for/consider would be extremely helpful!",1
t3_bypnk8,First job - feel bad negotiating salary and need advice,"The title pretty much sums it up. This is my first real job out of grad school. Back in February, I was hired in a part-time position for a small company while I trained and got my credentials taken care of. The deal was that they'd promote me to a full-time salaried employee within 6 months (8/1 was the original date) if I got everything sorted and did well. Well my boss shot me an email on Friday to schedule a meeting for this week because he's been impressed with the job I've done so far and wants to do the transition now.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply moving to full-time salaried is a big deal for me. Based on the paperwork I was given, I'll be getting the following benefits:

* Rather than a 401(k) match, the company contributes 3% of my annual salary.
* Right now, I get my health insurance through the state. Our employer pays 50% of the health insurance premium. From what other employees have told me, this should save me roughly $50-100 per month compared to what I'm paying now.
* More time off and paid sick time. Right now I get 8 days off (all personal, so paid sick leave). Full-time employees get at least 10 personal days and 4 sick days.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing is the salary. The salary comes out to about an extra $4,000/year compared to what I realistically make now (roughly $23/hour at \~37 hours/week). Based on my math, my salary comes out to the same rate ($23/hour), but just at 40 hours/week. So, roughly a 9% raise.

&amp;#x200B;

My partner has been urging me to try to negotiate the salary aspect, but I kind of feel bad. I was having a really hard time before I came here, and this is the first time in my life where I don't have to constantly worry about money. Plus, the owner takes good care of us. He'll order a really nice lunch for everyone once or twice a month or will pay for a company outing (e.g. drinks, food, and bowling). Plus, it's a small company and we've recently lost a few clients. So, it's not like there's a lot of money floating around to spare. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I shouldn't feel bad about advocating for myself, since I could definitely use more to help with my student loans and upcoming moving costs, but I do feel bad asking for more money. Especially when I'm already being offered what's effectively a 9% raise on top of that automatic 3% into the 401(k). So, I guess I'm looking for any advice anyone might have.",1

t3_byuvhy,Car Dealership trying to take back my truck after 3 months.,"I traded in a 2018 Honda Civic and bought a 2019 Ford F-150 Lariat in April 20, 2019 from a Ford Dealership in California. They gave me $21,000 for the car which I put towards the truck which costs $50,000 and the monthly payments were $1,000.  

I had been receiving emails from KeyPoint which is the credit union that I had the loan for the Honda civic with saying that they had not received payment from the car. I called the dealer numerous times and emailed them and they said they would take care if it and everything was good. 

This weekend I received a phone call from their finance department telling me that they had bad news and unfortunately I wasn’t approved for a loan from any bank. They said I had to bring the truck back and they would give me my car back. 

This doesn’t sound right to me and I was wondering if any one had any experience with this and if there was anything I can do?",1
t3_bysxb3,Selling a financed car?,"[US, Seattle area]

I have a friend who has a car that they want to get rid of.  They don't want the payment any longer and they don't want to trade it in as that would require a new payment (even if smaller).  They have a replacement vehicle already, which is paid for.

The car looks good, sounds good and drives good... but they wouldn't sell it to friends or family.  It is only a few years old and has a non-trivial blue book value.  The friend is upside down on the vehicle and will have to eat the negative equity by cash or/and personal loan.

Any advice on where to go to sell the vehicle? Are auto auctions a thing anymore?  They'd rather not sell it privately (financing, hassles) and realize that choice will cost an additional amount as well.

Thanks for any advice!",1

t3_bys1pf,How to Live Off Of One Income,"Hello,

My fiancé and I want to live off of one income (mine) while saving hers. We don’t need to do this as we save a lot per month, but we could stand to save a lot more without sacrificing retirement savings. How do we live off of one income?

Do we merge our checking accounts, put my salary in it, and then put her salary in our join savings account? Additionally, what do we do about our credit cards since they are currently tied to our individual checking accounts? 

My fiancée suggested us keeping our accounts separate and just aiming to save her salary together. I would pay more of our monthly expenses. This doesn’t seem like it would hold us very accountable. 

For those who do this, what steps should we take to live off of 1 income? 

Thank you,

Update - My fiancée and I chatted about this. We are going to individually contribute money into our joint wedding, honeymoon, and house savings account. I am contributing about $500 more per month. We are doing some heavy budgeting and aiming to save her monthly net salary. 

We are still maxing out our employee sponsored 401k and she is maxing our her HSA. We are also going to put our bonuses into the savings account as well. Her bonus is twice per year and more than my bonus. 

We will likely join our checking accounts 3-4 months after getting married and continue saving her monthly net salary to buy a house down the road.",1

t3_byrwes,Autopayment failed on student loan.,Long story short I've been on autopay for a subsidized student loan for a few years. January of this year the autopay did not work. I had no change in my bank account or anything that would cause this and it's paid every month since with no problem. I work long long hours and rarely check my emails or phone calls. 4 months went by and apparently I'm delinquent in my loan accounts with no real notice that there was a serious problem. Like I said it's paid every month since no problem and when I found out that my payment was marked as delinquent I instantly paid off the fee. Is it possible that I can get this removed from my credit report considering the autopayment failed on their end?

Getting out of debt is my number one priority right now, so I'm thinking about waiting to max out my 401k until I'm debt free. On the other hand, by maxing it out right now at age 21, that money will accumulate quite a lot of interest by the time I retire.

1. Discover
2. Capital One
3. Chase

The first couple are online banks (to my understanding) which makes me a little hesitant because I'm not familiar with the concept. My current bank did offer online banking, so I'm assuming is something very similar but I could always go to  one of their locations.

t3_bytfup,How will trad IRA interest affect taxes?,"This year, I opened up trad and Roth IRAs, and made the max backdoor Roth contribution.  I kept the traditional IRA open with a $0 balance after the transfer.

I just saw that I earned a bit of interest in the traditional IRA. Three questions:

1.  Does the interest comes from the time that the money sat in the traditional IRA prior to transfer?

2.  This doesn't put me over the max contribution limits, right?  Assuming this is ""no problem,"" on to question 3...

3.  I'm assuming this interest will be taxed, meaning next year, it counts as after-tax money.  When it's time for next year's backdoor contribution, I can just contribute the difference to the traditional IRA up to $6000 and convert it all in one go without owing more taxes, right?  I'm trying to imagine how *pro rata* would apply here, but I'm coming up blank. I have no other IRAs.

Example numbers if it's helpful:

- Contribute $6000 to traditional IRA (prev. at $0)
- Convert all to Roth IRA, Trad IRA balance back to $0
- Traditional IRA earns $6 interest at end of month

t3_byteht,Keeping Home Warranty as a Hedge Against old AC Units?,"Last year I purchased a home in Phoenix and the seller provided a home warranty. Normally I would be against renewing the warranty, but seeing that my two AC units are both 30 years old, I am debating renewing the warranty as a hedge against having to pay out of pocket for new AC units. Last year I was quoted $7k to replace a unit (honestly don’t remember if it was for one or two units) and I have a close neighbor who was recently quoted $11k to replace one unit. The home warranty is $480 a year, so as long as my units go bust in the next 10 or so years, It would be worth it.

t3_bytdqx,Advice on 401k allocations,"Hello,
&amp;nbsp;

I am a 31 year old whose company just switched over from MassMutual to Fidelity as a 401k manager, which has caused me to review my 401k allocations and just my 401k setup in general. I am wanting to be pretty aggressive with my investments, so I’ve been doing a lot of research lately into how to set up my allocations in order to maximize my returns. I created another post, and another user helped me to select my current mix, but I am curious as to just how important super low ER is and if a slightly higher ER but with better historical return may be a better option. I have approximately 18.5k in my 401k; 18k in my Roth IRA; 35k in some mutual funds (which actually feed my Roth IRA). I make 63,500/yr; I contribute 8% of my salary to my 401k (via Roth deferral) and my company matches 8% (pre-tax).

I want to get some opinions on the best mix that I can get given the investments that I am offered, and I was hoping you guys could provide some input. I’m trying to become a more informed investor, but I’m just getting my feet wet.

I am providing a few mixes that I came up with below. One of which, I came up with (trying to) using the 401k investment allocation advice I found using a ""Step-by-Step Guide to 401(k) Fund Selection"" post here on r/personalfinance

&amp;nbsp;

[Current Mix]
&amp;nbsp;

Here is my current mix, suggested by a user in the first thread that I created. The overall ER is 0.0252.

&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity 500 Index (FXAIX) – Large Blend – 45%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity International Index (FSPSX) – Foreign Large Blend – 35%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity US Bond Index (FXNAX) – Immediate Core Bond – 10%

&amp;nbsp;

[Financial Advisor Recommendation]
&amp;nbsp;

Here is what my financial advisor recommended, but I’m not really convinced this is the best option. Not sure what the total ER is (because I’m not sure what the ER of the funds within the BlackRock LifePath Target Date 2050 fund are).

&amp;nbsp;

-BlackRock Life Path 2050 Target Date Fund A (LIPAX) – Target Date 2050 – 95% (ER = 0.4; not sure what ER the funds within the target date fund have)
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX) – Small Blend – 5% (ER = 0.025)
&amp;nbsp;

(1yr = -0.154%; 3yr = 8.7225%; 5yr = 5.9795%; 10yr = ?)

&amp;nbsp;

[Fidelity “Very Aggressive” Model]
&amp;nbsp;

This model is terrible. It’s 1/3 in bonds, but I included it anyway because maybe the Fidelity people know what they are doing? The overall ER is 0.31225.

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Equity-Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) – Large Value – 23%
&amp;nbsp;

-Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Fund Class M (MWTRX) – Intermediate Core-Plus – 17%

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Federal Money Market Investor (VMFXX) – Money Market – 5%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index Fund (FSMAX) – Small Blend – 4%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Extended Market Index Fund – Mid-Cap Blend – 3%
&amp;nbsp;

(1yr = 2.4429%; 3yr = 7.6635%; 5yr = 5.3447; 10yr = 9.0044%)

&amp;nbsp;

[My Attempt to follow the 401k Allocations Advice from this Subreddit]
&amp;nbsp;

So, in my likely poor attempt to follow advice that I’ve read here on Reddit, I have come up with a mix of investments that I think best follows what I’ve read on here. The first thing that I did was take my age and subtract it from 120 to get 89 (rounded it up to 90) as my percentage of investments that I would invest in the stock market. The remaining 10% would be invested in bonds. The bond I selected was the Fidelity U.S. Bond Index, for no other reason than it has the best ER (0.025%) and it has pretty comparable returns compared to the other bonds.

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that 70% of my stock allocation should be in US stocks and 30% should be in international stocks. So 70% of 90% is 63%; 30% of 90% is 27%. Therefore, 63% of my total profile allocation should be to US stocks and 27% should be to International stocks. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have also read that one of the best techniques to select US stocks is to attempt to mimic the composition of the stock market. Something to the effect of 24% Large Value; 24% Large Blend; 28% Large Growth; Mid-Cap Value = 6%; Mid-Cap Growth = 6%; Mid-Cap Blend = 6%; Small-Cap Value = 2%; Small-Cap Growth = 2% and Small-Cap Value = 2%.

&amp;nbsp;

Since I am only offered 1 Large Value investment option, I chose Vanguard Equity Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) at 24% of my overall 63% US stock investment (15.12% overall). Similarly, I chose Fidelity 500 Index Fund as my Large Blend investment option, as it was my only choice at 24% of my overall 63% US stock investment (15.12% overall) and JP Morgan Large Cap Growth as my Large Growth investment option (again, my only option) at 28% of my overall 63% US stock investment (17.64% overall).

&amp;nbsp;

I did not have a Mid-Cap Value option, so I simply split the allotted 6% for this option evenly between my choices for Mid-Cap Growth and Mid-Cap Blend – 9% of the 63% US stock investment (5.67% overall) into Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund Class I (it was my only Mid Cap Growth option) and 9% of the 63% US Stock investment (5.67% overall) into the Fidelity Extended Market Index (it had a much better ER and performed better in most cases than the JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund Class I), respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

The only small-cap option I had was the Fidelity Small Cap Index, so I took the 2% that I would have put into Small-Cap Value and the 2% I would have put into Small-Cap Growth and put all 6% into this Small Cap Blend investment.

&amp;nbsp;

For the Foreign investments, I had read that it is advisable to put 81% into developed markets and 19% into emerging markets. I had no idea what “developed markets” meant, so I put 81% of the 30% allotted (21.87% overall) to International investments into Fidelity International Index (because its ER was way better than the American Funds EuroPacific Growth Fund Class R-4, and the returns were similar). For the emerging markets allotment, I put 19% of the 30% allotted (5.13% overall) into my only “diversified emerging” option, Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets.

&amp;nbsp;

The total mix of investments are listed below; the overall ER is 0.259189:

&amp;nbsp;

-Vanguard Equity Income Admiral Shares (VEIRX) – Large Value – 15.12%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX) – Large Blend – 15.12%
&amp;nbsp;

-JP Morgan Large Cap Growth (SEEGX) – Large Growth – 17.64%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Extended Market Index (FSMAX) – Mid-Cap Blend – 5.67%
&amp;nbsp;

-Carillon Eagle Mid Cap (HAGIX) – Mid-Cap Growth – 5.67%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity Small Cap Index (FSSNX) –Small-Cap Blend – 3.78%
&amp;nbsp;

-Fidelity International Index (FSPSX) – Foreign Large Blend – 21.87%
&amp;nbsp;

t3_byr70y,Customizing withholding on W4,"Every so often on here, somebody asks whether they can put down an absurd number of withholding allowances on their W4 to make their federal withholding zero and then just pay when they file their return. Inevitably, someone will chime in saying that you can, but you will pay penalties for under-withholding. Additionally, the IRS can request copies of employee's W4s from the company and investigate if somebody puts down a large number of allowances.

My situation is the following. I had uneven amounts of income for the first 6 months of the year but will be starting a salaried job with income well in excess of what I've earned in the past. I want to follow the prime directive and would like to build my emergency fund, then max 401k (good fund options in the plan), then max a Roth. I want to do this in order.

So my plan was to not contribute to 401k until efund was built, then divide 19k by the remaining number of paychecks and contribute that amount thereafter. This will make my tax withholding fluctuate. Moreover, if I just do 1 or 2 withholding allowances, I will be way over-withheld because I made so little the first half of the year.

My question is, can I just compute my year-end tax liability, and pay an unchanging amount toward it each paycheck by putting down a huge number of withholdings but then adding that amount in the space for ""additional withholding""? If I do this correctly, I won't have under-withheld so I can't be penalized for that. But if the IRS asks for my W4, I imagine they may think it's odd and investigate. Can they penalize me for a large number of allowances if I've added a reasonable non-under-withholding amount in the space for ""additional withholding""?",1

t3_byr4zd,When do I move out? (UK - Circumstances below),"Hi all,

I live with my Mum and Sister. They have poor mental health, the house is in disrepair and it greatly affects my own mood.
 I have just graduated university this year (hopefully, 3 days to go to results), to go into a job which would earn roughly 23k per annum minimum (not inc OT). Currently I work a pizza delivery job, netting about £350 a week, inc fuel but not car maintenance - though I just got a new one with emergency fund I had saved plus recent student loan (3K spent total), so costs for it should be lower as its only 10k miles clocked (spent near £400 on essential maintenance too).

 I have about £700 to my name currently. I have no other expenses beyond car stuff which is included in earned amount. I will soon pay my mum £50 a week for rent to help her with expenses. 

My question is this. As I am not yet in a big boy job, should I stay at home or rent a place local to get out of this house. Though I want to help my mum repair the house, I find living here affects my mental state to a large degree. I will still contribute to repairs after I move out, depending on need, I owe her for raising me and being a good mum.
 I can't say for certain when i will get the better job, probably a period of 6 months to a year. So should I move out? And if I did decide to, what kind of budget is acceptable to spend on a rental house? Obviously one with furniture is essential as I couldn't afford my own. Is a quarter of my monthly income acceptable or too much? 

Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you all.",1

t3_byt7ih,Dinq on my Credit Report Disappeared...help?,"So I am about to close on my first house (used tons of advice I got from here!!).  The first time they ran my credit for the application the loan officer let me know that I had a delinquency on my credit report and it would be good to get it taken care of before final approval.

So I took PF advice and called the debt collector in order to verify the debt.  The person I spoke with on the phone either didn't know what I meant or was trying to be intentionally dense.

I kept asking if they could please verify this debt in writing and the lady would be like ""Well...it's from such and such date and such and such place.""  She ended up kinda being like ""okay we will send you the debt in writing"".

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, about 60 days go by and I'm up to my final approval and my loan officer asks me how I got the debt removed from my credit report.  I thought ""yay! I asked for proof in writing, they could not provide it, so it has been removed from my credit report!""  Except for when today, when I got a letter from the debt collection agency.

It's a very simple letter...letterhead at the top and what looks like a simple excerpt of an excel spreadsheet....my name, debt owed and a file #...that's it.  Is this proof of debt?  I don't understand at all whats happened.

t3_byoo7i,Should I abandon Capital One?,"I'm going to try to keep this brief-   


I have been with Capital One since 2010. My checking account and emergency fund are in Capital One, and I have a credit card with them as well. Savings account with Ally, which I really do like, except it's a bit inconvenient because you know, it takes upwards of 5 business days to transfer $$.   


Up until a few years ago, despite having a credit card, I always stuck to my debit card to buy things so I didn't really mind that my credit card sucked ( high interest rate, low credit line, no rewards). One of the reasons I never used the card was because the credit limit is $500, which is the limit they gave me when I was in college back in 2014. Recently, I switched to their quicksilver card and have been using the card as my primary way to spend to get cash back and have been paying it off weekly.   


The thing is, seriously, for the past 2 years, I have been trying to get a credit line increase and every single time they deny the request. I fly internationally at least twice a year and with a $500 credit line it's not like I'll be able to purchase tickets with the card. I have the Discover IT card now with a way more practical credit limit that I'm considering making my primary card rather than the Capital One. I have called Capital One a handful of times in the past year or so about a credit line increase and they say no every time. This evening I called again and told the woman my situation and how I want a card to put airline tickets on, and the woman at Capital One basically told me to go ahead and use the Discover card because ""Capital One's cards aren't right for everyone"" LOL direct quote. Gotta love that customer service.   


I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. All of my CapOne accounts are in good standing, I have a 720 credit score and make $60k a year. Why is Capital One not trying to keep me as a customer? Additionally, the idea of using a card that isn't Visa or Mastercard seems a bit precarious. For those of you who use Discover, do you find that it is just as widely accepted as the other two? I am so annoyed with Capital One I just want to take my money out and put it in another bank. Does anybody have any suggestions? Where should I go from here? Should  I make the switch to Ally for all of my accounts? Where do y'all keep your emergency funds?",1
t3_byppqb,Moving to NYC from the UK - Salary Advice,"I've had a verbal offer from my current (tech) employer to move to our NYC office. I'm currently living in Edinburgh, UK and earning a good salary (£60k) that allows me to have a great middle class life. I'd be working in Brooklyn and I'm looking for advice on what to expect salary wise. I'm treating this as a 1-2 year opportunity to live in a different city, so I'm happy to save less to really experience the NY lifestyle. 

Expatistan suggests that NYC is \~70% more expensive, so that would take my salary to \~130k USD. Glassdoor / Hired suggest that people in my role earn around 140-150k USD.

I'd really like...

* A nice apartment (sharing is fine, but with a 'real' bedroom) within 1 hour walking distance of downtown Brooklyn.
* Enough money to eat out a couple of times a week, and to live healthily (Not a ramen diet, gym subscription etc.)
* Enough money to travel around America during my vacation.

t3_byt5zu,Thinking about buying a 20% interest in my parents' house to have a rental property,"My parents are preparing to move to a different city.  They were planning to sell their current house (which is subject to two mortgages) and buy a house in the new city.

That way, they could afford a downpayment on a house in their new city, while holding onto the old house.

t3_bykjzk,Pay off student loans or save for retirement and home?,"I currently have around $15,000 in student loans (all federal) with rates ranging from 3.4% to 4.86%, which is down many thousands from what I've paid in college and what I've been paying so far.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have a $1500 emergency fund and close $5,000 in a Roth IRA. My monthly expenses are around $2,500 and fairly inflexible, leaving me around $1300 in extra take-home pay each month. My partner and I are pretty good with money and follow a modest lifestyle with just occasional treats.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my late twenties now and my partner and I want to get married soon, buy a house in the next 5 to 7 years, and save for retirement.  We plan to have kids, but not for another 6 to 8 years. We don't know where we'll be physically living in the next few years,  but I would reckon we would want a home no higher than $200,000 (and that's really pushing it -- we'd probably go much lower). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got a new full-time job earning close to $60,000 a year. Once I got the new job my plan was to put around $1500 per month on the loans so that I could get rid of them in around a year, but I'm reconsidering that given how comparatively low the interest rates are compared to what other posters in this forum have.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: Does it make more sense to just get rid of those loans as fast and possible and the sock away lots for my retirement and buying a house, or should I pay the minimum (around $275) payment and save up for a retirement and home?

&amp;#x200B;

My gut and what I've read on this sub makes me feel like it makes the most sense to pay the minimum, maybe a little extra, but put most of my disposable income in boosting up my emergency fund then splitting money between retirement and a home.

t3_bymbk6,Can I leave a job after 3 months?,"Tl:dr: Boss is kinda useless isn’t making the changes that brought me there in the first place. Offer to double my pay, 401k matching, health and dental at another company. Boss paid money to help me get certified... can I move on after 3 months? 


So, I’ll start by saying that I picked a job up part time while I was finishing my degree that would transition to full time. The pay is okay, no benefits, but I like what I’m doing. I was hired because 1) a member of staff was retiring soon and 2) they needed to pump some younger blood into the office (I’m 22 everyone else is 55+). 

Here’s the problem, the guy I was replacing is the owners husband and she won’t let him retire because she has a shopping problem and doesn’t want him to be home going through her shit all day. This to me is ridiculous because she essentially has 4 employees but me and another could do the work of everyone. 

Okay, I want to reiterate I LOVE what I do. Like I genuinely enjoy my job and when we’re busy time flies and I’m enjoying myself. 

Problem two... and I know when you’re the boss you get to do this shit but it’s ridiculous. We open at 8:30 and my boss consistently comes in past 11 when she has shit to do and clients to call and we are losing business because of it. Her office is a mess, we can’t have anyone come in there because it’s embarrassing. Mind you another reason I was hired is so she could do yearly reviews with clients and spend her day doing that. 

Problem 3/4... okay so she won’t let her 72 year old husband retire, she already has too many people working for her (one of which is incompetent) and she wants to hire another.... she knows a girl who’s moving here who I believe is mid to late 20’s that she wants to hire. 

I really enjoy what I do and I’d like to run my own business (in the same field I’m in now) one day. However, I have an offer to double my salary (65k is promised with up to 20k in bonus potential) with health, dental, 2.5 weeks of pto every 6 months, and 401k matching. 

No brainer, but my boss has shelled out about a grand for some training and tests and stuff to help me get certified. Is it okay to move on? I don’t wanna burn bridges because I enjoy the people I work with just not in... a work capacity I guess. Honestly if I left I’d be cutting my boss a check which would make me feel a lot better. 

I just need to know if this is an okay move... I know it’s better for me but I can’t help but feel scummy. I’ve tried to express my discontent with her not doing the things I’ve asked or with the fact she hasn’t let her husband retire (he asks her literally every Friday if it can be his last day).

Edit: Thanks! I’m not under any contract so I should be free to go whenever. As long as everything stays the way it is I will be moving on in July. Thank you guys!",1

I was hoping to get a house closer to $100,000, but if I were to get this house it really has the makings of a forever home for me. Everything looks updated and well maintained, and sits in a secluded area off a main road. The house also has most of the features I am looking for.

The personal loan would be from my mother. She wants me to get a house in a decent area and also is has room for her to store some furniture and other for her while she lives with my grandmother, which could be another 5+ years. Also she will be moving back to my area, and the house will be big enough for her to stay there while she gets something for herself. However much money I accept from her, I will immediately work on putting that much cash away in addition to my emergency fund (which I plan to get to 15k). The loan will have terms written down and signed by both parties, a copy each.

Honestly I could save up the money if I had more time, but my brother is adamant on moving out of the apartment and going his own way. I do not think it is advisable for him to do so, but that is another story. Anywhere if I rent by myself would greatly reduce my savings rate, and so I think the better move is to buy. My mortgage payments, taxes, etc would be less than rent. Yes, I know there other expenses.

House in question is 2,000 sqft (400 upstairs, 800 downstairs finished basement), .4 acre lot. Everything looks recently updated and well kept. House is in a quiet neighborhood and has quick access to a highway for my commute.

I am single with no kids, and probably will prefer to stay that way (especially the no kids).

My job is with Toyota Boshoku as a production worker and I think my job is stable for the foreseeable future. They are adding new lines and are having hiring events often. Not the most glamorous job, but the benefits are hard to beat (no health, dental, or vision insurance premiums)

So am I overextending going for a house at this price? What costs am I missing?

Also how does one go about getting the best loan quote?

Thanks for the help.

Edit: So personal loans are a big “No” when it comes to mortgages. Usually it is recommended to have the 20%, does that mean if I really want this home I will have to get a loan with PMI?

Edit 2: Could my EE Bond be used in the downpayment to make it to the 20%?

Edit 3: Another question, what if my realtor is the same agent as the house I am looking to buy...is that good or bad?",1
t3_byoso2,401k match advice,"So I just graduated college and start my first full time job. My company gives me a pretty shitty match, 25% of the first 4% I put into it. At least it’s something eh?I have two questions. 

It says it will auto enroll me at 4%, does that mean they are taking 4% of my annual or just 4% of every paycheck? I just want to contribute the minimum to get the match.

Does it make sense to only contribute enough to get that 401k match and then open a Roth IRA for the rest of my savings?

t3_byq7qi,Can I deposit a BofA balance transfer offer into my checking account and use my personal funds to pay off a different BofA card as a loophole?,"I own two Bank of America credit cards (A &amp; B). I recently received a balance transfer offer for 0% APR til next year for Card A which currently has a $0 balance. Card B is was in the introductory 0% APR promo period which is ending in a few weeks and will be at 25% APR (its a travel card I got and had no problems paying in full up until recently when I used it to help ease my relocation out of state). Now I know I have incoming funds to cover Card B, which has a $2000 balance.

Technically, Bank of America DOESN'T allow you to use these check offers to pay off another credit account of theirs. BUT **would I be able to pay off Card B using my own funds in my checking account** **right now and just transfer a roughly equivalent amount from Card A's check offer** **into my checking account** to replenish that payment I made on Card B?

The reasoning behind this is because I'd only be paying \~$45 for the balance transfer fee and then I'd have an extension of time to pay off that new balance as opposed to being charged the 25% APR when the promo period ends on Card B. I'm confident in having the funds within the next 3 paychecks-- I was just worried if Bank of America would retract their offer if I did this since it's not a restriction for the offer but it's walking the fine line in terms of how I'm wanting to use it.

Appreciate any advice/thoughts in advance! Thanks :)  


EDIT: To clarify, this offer can be used as EITHER a Balance Transfer between cards OR as a Cash Advance / Convenience Check with the same 3% transaction fee for either usage.",1

t3_bymhz3,"26 YO jobless needing help with career, finance, future, and life in general","Some background (you can probably skip this if you want to):


I’m currently in a bad situation right now. I studied for the MCAT after finishing my masters and bombed it. I’m very depressed because I didn’t have any motivation to study for it and at this point don’t care about medicine. I studied biochem in college and did a masters in something similar for no reason other than I was too embarrassed to go back to school for something else. My high GPA in undergrad convinced me not to give up on medicine and explore the idea at a later date. Sunk cost fallacy. Well I did, and failed. I know I can do well on the MCAT, but at this point it’s over. After you put in a ton of effort to get As in almost all of your classes, it’s hard to give up on that. 

Applications have already started and I won’t get into MD programs and to be honest, I don’t have the will anymore. I only care about having a stable job and moving on in my life. I’ve always been depressed. Medicine is hard for even mentally healthy people and you throw in depression, OCD and low self confidence, it’s a recipe for disaster. My motivations in life have changed from having a career with purpose to having a career period. It’s one of the reasons why I was reluctant to go into medicine in the first place. I was afraid of becoming a recluse in med school and becoming even more depressed than I was in college. 

I’m living with my parents and need to get out. At this point due to my tumultuous relationship with one parent, I can’t stand living with them and I need to stop being a burden on them. I feel like a waste of space. I’ve felt like that since high school and the feeling never goes away. It’s not just my current predicament that’s making me feel that way, I’ve always felt that way. I’ve always had a feeling that that mentality was the reason why I’d always put myself in bad situations throughout my whole life. I’ve always felt that I deserve bad things in life and it’s easier to just dream of good things. I’ve self sabotaged myself over and over. I’m going to see a psychiatrist in about month and figure things out mentally before I’m kicked off insurance soon. I could have done that years ago, but no I waited till the last minute as usual. 

I can put in effort in school like getting As but it feels like I’m doing it for nothing. Maybe because I was premed that was the reason why. There was no job at the end of the line. It was more school and depression (in my eyes), so I gave up. I’m afraid I’ll do the same with whatever else I pursue next. 


Now what I need help on:


My parents paid for my schooling. My undergrad was pretty much free as I lived at home and tuition was covered. I don’t have much debt from that other than probably gas money. My masters was around 25k. I intend to pay them back for this no matter what happens, but fortunately my parents were able to pay this without taking out a loan.

I’m soon to be 26. I have a masters in informatics, but the program was worthless. My PI told me the curriculum was not computationally heavy at all. It was just a garbage masters, but some of my classmates got decent jobs out of school. There’s some demand for masters in STEM, but I feel long term it’s not a great career path. I went through with it thinking I’d just do medicine anyway so no big deal. But I didn’t plan anything at all. 

Now I have about 20k in savings, but very little income. About 10k income probably from part time job but I pay for very little right now because I’m living at home and food is mostly covered. Once I become independent, I don’t know what I’ll do in terms of financial planning. Living with my parents my whole life, I always had a safety net and I’m clueless. 

So some of my options are the following: find full time employment in a field that’s probably dead end, go back to school for CS partly through community college, self study CS and hope my academic background (high GPA and masters) get me a job somewhere. I’ve planned out the financing of getting a CS bachelors. It would be roughly 20-25k, but it would also depend on my FAFSA. Because I have savings and my 2017 tax forms show an income (~10-12k), I’m scared I’ll get zero grant money. I’ve heard of people get upwards of $6000 and work study money if you have an EFC of near 0, but I don’t believe I would qualify. 

What advice do you have for me? How should I plan this out? I also need to understand retirement and I’m already behind my peers who got careers already when it comes to savings and retirement. What can you tell me about that?

On a deeper level, I’m worried I’m just sinking further into a rabbit hole of failure. I gave up on medicine a couple of times, couldn’t fully commit to switching to CS and now I’m back to doing the same thing. Now I’m also worried that if I do CS I won’t really succeed in it and I’ll be in a worse place. What if I end up graduating and all I can get is a job paying 60k and I’m too lazy to improve upon that?

Too many what ifs and I’m scared.",1

I am currently contributing 6% to my 401k Pre-Tax (with a company match of 6%) and then another 4% of my salary into a Roth with $10,500 vested out of the $20,000 balance with a vesting schedule that will be at 100% at 5 years.

t3_byrody,0% APR Credit Card for New Car?,"Hello everyone,

I have a relatively common situation and wanted everyones' input. I am in the market for a new car and was wondering what the best approach would be. 

Here is my current idea:

1. Open a 0% APR credit card for 15 months(Chase Freedom, which allows for 0% APR credit transfers too).
2. Buy slightly used 2019 corolla for \~15k using one of my other credit cards that has a 16k credit limit allowing me to pay in full and avoid any dealer financing.
3. Transfer the \~15k to my Chase Freedom card and pay that off before the 15 months is up.

I figured paying in ""cash"" at the dealer would allow me more leverage to negotiate the price down. My main questions are:

* *Can I use a credit card to pay the full purchase price at the dealer?*
* The chase freedom credit says it allows balance transfers at 0% APR for 15 months. My most recent   
Chase credit card has a \~16k credit limit. *If I apply for this Chase Freedom card, will it likely have a similar credit limit so that transferring over the \~15k from the car purchase won't be a problem?* My intent is to sell my current vehicle for around 6K after getting the new car, and pay off what I can early on so even if my credit limit isn't 15k, it wouldn't be the worse thing. *How can I gauge what my new credit limit will be?*

That's about it. Thanks everyone!


EDIT: What I am hearing is:

- Dealers typically only let you pay up to $5,000 on credit.
- Dealers will pass the ~3% interest charge on to me.
- Balance transfers come with an additional 4-5% fee. 
- No real discounts for cash buyers.

So for this situation dealer financing is a better bet.",1

I have a corporate Amex as an employee of a large company. The other day, I logged in and received an invitation to apply for a personal card. (it didn't say pre-approved). The offers were BCP, Gold and Platinum.  


Here's the verbiage:   


# Welcome to the Corporate Advantage Program:

## In recognition of your Corporate Card Membership, you’re invited to apply for exclusive Personal Card offers.

I would do it in a heartbeat except for the following reasons:  


1. I just recently got my first Amex card (Blue Cash Everyday, 2 weeks ago).
2. The credit limit is just $500 (Because my experian was 658 with a collection on it. it is now 732).
3. I have a bunch of recent inquiries on my report
4. My credit scores range from 720 to 732(on Experian) with no collections on them (anymore) and perfect on-time payments, but my credit history is less than 2 years.

  
Is this program a backdoor into getting a an AMEX Gold or Platinum without having to worry about credit report, or will they still do a pull like any other regular application?",1
t3_bynijb,How to move HSA savings to invest?,"I have money in an HSA with a local bank my job picked that I would prefer to setup in a vanguard or even ally account, etc to better invest.

t3_bynhtw,Should I buy out siblings for house?,"Wondering if it would be best to buy out their interest and live in it or sell the inherited house (California) and continue to rent an apartment. What would you do?
Details:

House worth $850K, $800K if sold (agent fees, etc)

Buyout for each sibling (3) would be ~200K or more.

Have ~200K in Ally, 200K in equity on my house currently being rented out, and 300K in 401K.
 
If I want to keep the 300K in the 401K then I would have to get a mortgage for ~200K (not sure how getting a mortgage works in a buyout situation) to buy them all out.

Current age 56, plan on retiring at 62 with monthly gross of $4300.

Apartment rental is $2500 per month.

Tax on inherited house would be 3K per year (assuming I can keep it at the old inherited tax basis at 300K instead of 850K)

I figure mortgage would be 1500 per month for 15 years at 4%

If I rent then I would get interest on 400K (my 200K and my share of the 800K house)  along with $750 profit rental income from my $250K house.

Another option is buying a condo for $600K so I may get away with not having a mortgage but would have 6K in tax plus another 4K in HOA fees but lose out on interest and rental income.

If I buy the house I could rent out two rooms for $1500 a month to save on the mortgage.

t3_byr8k0,Moving to work in the US. How best to deal with my loans?,"Yes, I want to pay them off as soon as possible. Currently:

&amp;#x200B;

* Car Loan: $3800 CAD, paying $350 CAD / month. 3.5% interest
* Eye Surgery: $4200 CAD. This is new, but decided to get this done before moving for quality of life reasons.
* Wife's OSAP (Student loan), about 15k CAD

&amp;#x200B;

So my strategy was simple but maybe I am missing something obvious. I am living in US, getting paid in USD, thus I will move money to CAD via a cross-border account (RBC) and pay these loans off with the exchange advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

Does that make sense? Any tricks around this? I effectively see it as a premium payment on loans, and my intention would be to rid of the first two before end of year.

I just paid off my student debt and reevaluating my current finances.  28/M making $55k and have a combined personal + employer contribution of  20% to my 401K. No other source of debt, I pay my CC bill in full each month, 14 year-old Honda paid off and keeping it until it breaks down. I have $17k for emergencies with $20k earmarked for a used car (including registration fees and dealership charges) and/or car repairs.

I'm renting an apartment for about $1,300 per month including utilities.  Putting about $200/month in a brokerage to learn more about investing and learn more about the market. My goal is to max contributions in a Roth and an HSA while maintaining a $600-700/month budget on other  expenses (internet, food, gym membership, gas, fun). No goals to purchase a house until 5-10 years in the future. This leaves me about a little less than $200/month of wiggle room on medium term goals or as a fund so I don't have to tap into my emergency fund.

Understand this is likely a personal preference, but am I saving too much? I used to put less than half of the max into my Roth and HSA when paying off student debt, and typically had $800 or so per month which was used as a wiggle room fund.",1

t3_byk2bf,Should I cancel my Guardian Whole Life at 95 Account?,"As the title says, thinking about closing this account. I opened this account back in late 2011 - I honestly didn’t know much about this or finances in general at the time. My daughter had been born in early 2011 so really my thinking was I would get life insurance and be able to start saving for college. My premium on this has been $500 a month since the start.

At that point in my life I was very naive about finances / investing and most things money related and although I am still not an expert I think I have improved pretty significantly.

Over the years I have taken about $10000 out of the cash value for various reasons - not really understanding how interest works on this account. As I’m sure some of you know the interest on this is pretty significant. My loan balance at this point is about $19000.

&amp;#x200B;

All of the values in the account at this point  are as follows:

* Death Benefit: $600000
* Cash Value: $31000
* Loan Balance: $19000

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told by some people that if I were to work to pay off the loan balance than the cash value would rise significantly. I have also read some posts on reddit that say whole life is a bad investment - so I’m trying to figure out what I should do here.

&amp;#x200B;

I think my options are: 

* continue paying the premiums and work to pay off the loan balance. If I do this, should I basically be paying this premium for the rest of my life? Or does it make sense to stop at some point when I’m older and my cash value is high enough?
* Cut and run - close the account - get the $12000 balance (cash value - loan) and invest it elsewhere. I would forfeit the death benefit and ultimately this will be a significant loss - I have put in about $45000 into this and will have gotten back the $10k and $12k so my loss is about $23000 - it sucks but I don’t want to keep paying it just because I’m at a loss I would rather cut my losses than keep feeding a bad investment. I would want to get some other life insurance maybe a term life policy since I have kids. This would also free up the $500 a month I was putting here and I can put that elsewhere (suggestions welcome)
* Maybe you guys have some other suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Other personal info if needed: 

* 30 year old
* Two kids 
* I have a separate 100k life insurance policy through work 
* Own home - $134k left on mortgage at 3.65% interest rate - this is my only debt at this time besides this loan balance 
* $160k annual income 
* I have been maxing out a 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA for 3 years and will continue to do so hopefully until I retire. 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any suggestions. Sorry if the post is long. Thank you

EDIT: thank you guys for the advice and for not flat out calling me an idiot even though you all probably think I am lol .. so pretty much we are all in agreement this was a bad investment so I’m gonna take the loss and get out of it 

So these will be the steps I take: 

I will get term life first before canceling 
Then I will cancel and cash out the $12k
I will put the 12k into 529s for my kids and start funding those monthly

t3_byo69y,Finally taking my finances seriously - Need help on account management (Germany),"Hey there!

Let me start off by saying that I've read a lot on here in the past few days. It's mostly really helpful, though most of the advice here seems to be for US only. I'm from Germany, don't know if that matters.

So, here's the deal. 

For my entire (22 yo) life I've been living ""paycheck to paycheck"" (Which never was much, because I was a student and am now in Uni). I never really learned how to handle my money and I was always broke.

A few months ago I started freelance Webdesign work and got my first couple of works done. I've saved up a little bit on my one account. 

I've got around 1200€ I have to pay back to friends &amp; family of mine. Don't ask, I was stupid back then. 

I have around 2400€ on my account now. I've actually never had that much, ever. 2400-1200 = 1200. I don't want that money go to waste, so I am seeking out for advice. I don't think I'm looking to invest just yet, but I'm having difficulties setting up my accounts so I can save up nicely and keep it separated. 

I have a small monthly income from my uni (Doing dual studies, working &amp; going to uni at the same time). I also get ""child benefits"" (Kindergeld in Germany). 

The biggest chunk of my income will be from Webdesign projects in the future. 

I want to save up. Stop living paycheck to paycheck and just don't know how. How many accounts do I need?

One for saving and one for everything else? I was thinking about creating 3 accounts: Saving (Never touching that), one for emergencies like a broken car and one for everything else. Does that make any sense?

t3_byqgoa,Predicting how removing myself as a authorized user on a credit card will effect my score,"So I am 23, have some serious student loans but a pretty good income for it and a good amount in savings. I have a single very low ($1000) credit limit credit card that I always pay off and rarely come close to using even half or a third of the limit, so I carry no consumer credit card debt at the end of the month except on my mother's card, which I am an authorized user of. The average age of my credit is 4 years old, I have a modest car loan, and I never miss payments. Still my credit score is just barely north of 650 and I hoped to raise it before I applied for a credit card to use for most of my consumer purchases, which I want for security reasons because I currently use my debit card more than I think safe. I started to look at a credit report and realized that I was still an authorized user on my mother's credit card, which has a higher ($19,200) credit limit that is 92% used up, with no prospect of paid down quickly in the near future. It seems this is hurting the credit utilization aspect of my credit score, so I am thinking about having myself removed as an authorized user to improve my credit. I am certain my mother won't care, I think we both forgot I was made an authorized user many years ago when I was in high school.

The problem is, even though the high utilization of this card may be hurting my credit score in one way, the fact that payments on such a card are always being made on time probably helps my credit score some, or it may be holding such a card may help in other ways since my only other sources of credit right now are student loans, a car, and a single super low credit limit credit card. I suppose I also pay rent and utilities and such too. I am not sure what exactly will happen to my score if I removed myself as an authorized user. If it will raise my score, is there a way I can tell how much or how quickly? Might I end up somehow accidentally lowering my score, by removing the only serious consumer credit card I have on my report? Is there anyway I can predict what will happen? I am just too inexperienced at these things to feel confident in my initial guess that it will help.

t3_bypq2x,Student Loans Help,"Hi r/personalfinance! Asking y’all this question bc I don’t trust anyone in my family’s financial decisions and forgot everything from high school economics! ha

I’m about to be a junior in college and so far have $7,561 in federal student loans with an interest rate of 5.1%. I’m about to take out another $7,500 in federal student loans this year, and probably again next year, with hopefully somewhere near the same interest rate. With financial aid and loans, the rest of my school and rent comes out to $13,000 per year, which my dad wants me to get a loan for. This comes out to about $48,500 in loans (3 years of $7,500 in government loans, and two years with private loans of $13,000). The private loan I have been approved for with no co-signer from Discover (Sallie Mae did not approve me without a co-signer) has me at a variable interest rate of about 11%, or a fixed interest rate of about 12%, meaning my $13,000 would become $37,323 by the time I pay it all off. 

I guess I’m just wondering if this is not as bad as it seems in my mind and I should take the loan, or if there’s a better alternative, or if this is just straight up a bad idea.

t3_byld8b,My Top Five Personal Finance Books (and Key Takeaways),"My top five personal finance books are Rich Dad Poor Dad and Cashflow Quadrant by Robert Kiyosaki; I Will Teach You to Be Rich by Ramit Sethi; What Would the Rockefellers Do? by Garrett B. Gunderson and Michael G. Isom; and The Richest Man in Babylon by George S. Clason. 

The biggest take aways from my recent readings are as follows (listed as steps and prioritized more or less based on the order in which someone may abide these laws most effectively):  

1) Pay yourself first. Or: Save money automatically. 

Whether you add a savings account to your direct deposit form with your employer and allocate a percentage of your after-tax income to be sent to that account in addition to your checking account or you set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account at your local bank: you must pay yourself first, and you must pay yourself automatically. 

2) Next is to manage your expenses; create a value-based spending plan and stay committed to it. 

Eliminate destructive expenses, manage lifestyle expenses, and then consider how you want to spend your money on productive and protective expenses, but base these decisions on a conscious plan that factors in the value that your spending adds to your life. Always consider value above price and cost. (This is crucial!) 

Course correct once a month. If you can’t stay committed to your plan, then find someone who will keep you committed to your plan. 

3) After you have done this, you should concentrate on eliminating high-interest debt. Accelerate debt payments using proven strategies that will allow you to increase principle payments and boost monthly cash flow. 

4) After this is done, concentrate on protecting the wealth you have created (and are continuing to create) from predators, creditors, and any other unforeseen conditions that could potentially put your wealth at unnecessary risk of being transferred. 

(Clue: adequate insurance coverage.)

5) After you have put together this basic infrastructure, you can concentrate on increasing your ability to earn. Increase your income. Invest in yourself. Increase your mental and relationship capital. Acquire assets that are aligned with your own personal financial goals and your own unique vision of purpose. (Remember: Dollars follow value.) 

One basic bonus lesson about credit: keep it simple. You really only need one card (three at most). Use these to satisfy fixed costs automatically and earn a modest return on your everyday spending. 

This will allow you to group all of your recurring costs together into one account and give you one due date instead of many. Always pay the balance in full.

This will make managing your cash flow a breeze.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background—I am currently a student studying Industrial Engineering, about two quarters away from graduating (will finish in winter 2020). I have zero student loan debt and work two part time jobs to cover rent and food. My hours are super inconsistent, but I make enough to pay for $835 in rent and roughly $250 in food (I try and eat really healthy and have boiled it down to this at the lowest.)

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have two credit cards, and with some unforeseen expenses and a trip to Europe I thought I would be able to pay off, I am sitting at roughly $2200 on one (22.84% variable APR) and $3000 on another (25.53% variable APR).

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so this summer I am going to be working on my startup venture out of an accelerator program. Who knows if we will be successful, or how successful we will be, but things are looking pretty promising. I'll be working on this full time, probably up to 50 hours a week, for the duration of the summer. I am given $10,000 in funding for the accelerator, I am planning on using a portion of this to pay for my rent and food, as I will not be able to work any other full time job. I am also thinking of getting a different part time job (one is too inconsistent, one is only during the school year) but I worry that this will detract from the time and energy that I can devote to my startup.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like get rid of this debt somehow, stop accruing interest, and stop my credit score from declining like it is  (was at 770, now down to 630 and still declining). If my startup is successful, when I start paying myself a full salary or when I sell it I should have more than enough money to pay this debt off completely, but this is  some unknown time into the future. I am currently able to make my minimum payments no problem, but hate to see my score declining like this.

Please let me know if I missed any crucial information. Just help me out here as to my best options. Some that I see are:

\-Take out student loan, use to pay off cc debt. Smaller interest rates here, but longer term.

\-Take out personal loan to consolidate debt.

\-Just keep chipping away at it with slightly-above minimum payments until I can pay them off in full.

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking to a (distant) relative of mine the other day, who does really well for a living, and we brought up finance &amp; investments and he told me about an investment he's currently in. Basically he does business with this commercial bank (as a client), and he said how his assigned banker whom he had known for a while always used to present him with investment opportunities. Now he talked about how this guy isn't like most bankers or people in the industry he had come across who would just want to come up with ways to fool people into deals just to make commission whether it was a good or bad investment, he actually recommended him a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this banker apparently had several investment opportunities, both within the bank and outside on his own projects. And there was one in particular whom he was doing individually that revolved around arbitrage and making about 9-12% return per year pretty safely (i.e. no speculation or high risk). My friend said he tried it out at first with a smaller amount to test how it goes, and he was happy with the result and realized it was legitimate and went forward with more. Didn't mention any numbers, but I contacted the banker and asked more about it, etc. The minimum requirement is $200k, to be deposited with a third-party (respectable) broker which I had previously done business with.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's why: I am trying to set up my accounts with the right amount of money in my checking account, and there are two competing forces. First, it's not a good thing to have too much in my checking account: I should move some to savings or even investments. Secondly, it's not a good thing to have too little, so that I go below the minimums required to avoid fees, or even worse have payments refused (racking up even more fees).

&amp;#x200B;

Almost all my spending is on my credit card, which is automatically paid off every month without me needing to do anything. If I had a mechanism that sent an alert when my checking account would fall too low to pay my credit card bill, then I could keep my checking account balance lower - and earn more in other places.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, I can set things up so that if my checking account balance goes below $x, I get an alert. I can set things up so that if my credit card balance goes above $y I get an alert. Can I set things up so that I get an alert if $(x-y) &lt; $z ?

&amp;#x200B;

t3_byoli3,Need help removing a derogatory mark on my credit report.,"Last summer I had just graduated from college and had yet to find a job so I was still on my parents health insurance. I ended up splitting my head open playing basketball and went to and urgent care to get it checked out. They gave me some dissolvable stitches and I went on my way. 

I’ve since found a job and got on my own health insurance. Unknown to me, my mom waited until early this year to pay the $200 bill (about 6 months after it was sent). I started getting voicemails in February from a collection agency that were very vague and said I owe them money. The number always came up as blocked on my caller ID so I never answered them. 

More recently, one of the voicemails detailed it was a medical bill from the same company that I went to the urgent care at. I spoke to my mom and she told me she paid the medical company earlier this year. She confirmed she waited to pay it, something about not wanting to go over their deductible. She told me to just ignore the voicemails since the bill was already paid they would go away. 

However, now the debt has been reported as a derogatory mark on my credit report and my FICO score dropped 100 points from 760 to 660. I looked into it and typically medical bills are sent to collection after 180 days so I’m sure that’s what happened. I guess my question is what would be the best way to get this removed. Should I contact the original medical company and see if they can get the debt collection agency to do something? Should I speak with the debt collectors and negotiate some partial payment/removal from my credit report? 

I know it was poor judgement to let my parents handle it in the first place but I was living at home at the time with no income so they were doing me a huge favor.

t3_byok8g,Car Purchasing Question,"Hi PF! First time poster here, so go easy.

I was planning to get a new (to me) car later this year, but the opportunity to purchase a lightly used car from a friend (of a friend) has come up. This is the exact make/model I was planning to buy later this year. This car is notorious for being driven hard and modified. It's not easy to find a good used one, so this is a special scenario.

My plan was originally to sell my car so that I would only need a loan for 50% of the purchase (and pay the rest off quickly). However if I purchase now, I would need to take a loan out for the full price of the car and then sell my current car over the next few months and instantly pay back 50% of the loan. Is this a crazy risky move?

I know that if I do this, the monthly payment will be higher, but this shouldn't matter since I was planning to pay 3 to 5x the payment amount every month anyways. I will spend more on interest, but it shouldn't be significant.

This also will delay the achievement of some financial goals for several months, which bothers me, but wouldn't keep me awake at night.

What are your thoughts on this purchase? Generally, this goes against my principal of never taking a loan (other than for a mortgage), but I wanted to get some opinions on what to do before I make a decision. 

And of course, if I really wanted to walk my talk, then I would get a car that's half the price. But I wanted something extremely safe and reliable, and I love sports cars 😀 I know the money would be better spent on an appreciating asset, but I just really want a nice car.

TL;DR Was planning to buy new car later this year, but the exact make and model is available from a trusted person. 

EDIT: Update, test drove car and tentatively agreed to $26K pending inspection. This one is a year old, and price for new is $31K, but I could get one for $29K after haggling. The car comes with about $500 in accessories I would have purchased anyways. I was planning for this price, but would have preferred a price of 24-25K. But honestly, the $1K more than I tried for is worth the cost of not having to spend an entire day or week haggling at a dealership (which has to be my absolute least favorite thing to do)

t3_bysyc5,Why car dealerships have limits on credit cards,"Recently had a customer who wanted to buy a $27,000 car and put it all on her credit card for the points. She had the cash to pay for the car, she just wanted to put it on all her credit card and then pay it off and get a bunch of points.

We said ""no"" she got a little upset so I just thought I'd share this experience and explain why we said no. 

The car industry has incredibly low margins. You can call me a liar all you want but alot of times when I sell a car, its for a loss. When I do make a profit its normally a very slim margin. Especially when its a 2018 Escape and we are thousands below invoice (as was the case here)

Now credit card companies charge a fee, I believe ours sits around 2.5%~ Or so depends on stuff anyway. When you swipe your card we have to pay about 2.5%

2.5% of $1,000 is $25 when your buying a $27,000 car thats $675 in fees to the bank. An ACH transaction costs us $1. If we allowed her to pay the car on a credit card we'd be losing $675 in fees. 

In this case were already losing about $2,500 on the deal, to lose another $675? Yea no thanks. And in most deals $675 is more then the entire net profit on the deal. 

So this is why car dealerships generally have limits on credit cards.

Now I do have a friend who sells Porsche, they will allow everyone to pay with credit card. However if you do, they charge you 3% more to cover the cost of the fee. Most customers decide that spending $3,000 more on a car to pay with your credit card isn't worth it.",1

The only medication that exists for it costs $240 every month even after insurance (blue cross blue shield federal). The other big cost is doctors visits since I have one to two every week lately (things have gone downhill and I’m trying new treatments) so it’s usually 35-70 dollars a week in copays. Supplements that help like aloe Vera capsules and Cystoprotek are ordered every month and aren’t cheap either ($130 per month in total) but I rely on them to keep the pain down. Medical supplies are another addition since I need to keep refilling all the self catheterization supplies I need at home (syringes, catheters, cleaning supplies).

It’s wearing me out how much money I spend just to get by health wise every month, my savings aren’t adding up. Is there anything I can do about these costs? I’m a recent graduate living in a cheaper apartment in Seattle with my boyfriend.",1

t3_bynz6i,Please help me understand the difference between an ETF and a mutual fund when both are tracking the same index.Which one is the better investment?,"As a disclaimer - please don't bash me for the newbie question, trying to understand how everything works :) 

&amp;#x200B;

So, as the title says, I am trying to figure out the difference between an ETF and a mutual fund that track the same index (e.g. S&amp;P500). 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the ETF has dealing charges compared to the mutual fund which doesn't and I get that the ETF is being traded on an exchange every day same as a stock but at the end of the day both are tracking the same index and will bring the same returns(?). Also I understand that mutual funds are usually actively managed whereas ETFs are passive index funds.

&amp;#x200B;

Real life example: 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They both track the S&amp;P500 (maybe tiny variations in the exposures). Which one would be the best option to invest in for the long term? Is there any scenario where one would perform much better and the other worse even though they track the same index?

t3_bynz2r,23yo needs help getting money and life in order,"Hey all, I graduated last year from a big state school with an English degree and 32,000 in federal loan debt. I haven’t started making payments yet since I’m currently in the process of getting a teaching license and have received a deferment. My family came into some money recently and my parents are helping me with tuition, so I do not have to take out loans for the teaching license program. I have one year left in the program and will begin my teaching career next fall at 24. I anticipate making 40-45,000 as a first year teacher before deductions. I plan to move into administration before my 40s, hopefully maxing out my earning potential at 150-200k. Assuming the state pension fund doesn’t crap out, I should be able to live and retire comfortably. I will inherit a significant sum of money in the next 10 years, and as a teacher, will be eligible for PLSF and other deductions off my student loans; I’m not concerned about paying off my loans, or my financial well being in the next 20+ years. 

I’m very concerned about my financial well being right now and for the next 10 years however— I feel that I am significantly behind my peers (recent college grads) in terms of financial know-how.

I’m currently working the same job I worked throughout undergrad. I don’t make much, only 13/hour which comes out to 800/1,000 every two weeks during the summer. During the school year I work reduced hours and make about 400/500 every two weeks. I have ~1,500 in a savings account I recently started and will be putting in 20% of my paycheck every two weeks. I own an older car, which I paid for in cash and keep well maintained. My monthly expenses are as follows—

Rent—480
Utilities—120
Groceries—200
Car insurance—120
Gas—100
My family has a shared cell phone plan, and I am still under my parents’ health insurance.
My entertainment budget is minimal.

During the school year I essentially live paycheck to paycheck, hence having only ~1,500 in savings at 23. My budgeting skills are rudimentary at best, and I have no understanding of investments—stocks, bonds, etc. I have never owned a credit card and my credit score sits around 670 as of writing this post. I have a very limited understanding of loans because I have been renting for the past 3 years and paid for my old beater car in cash. Basically, I don’t really know how to “adult” yet, and I don’t really know how or where to start.

Any and all financial advice is greatly appreciated!",1

t3_bynuq1,"Not sure who to ask for advice, getting a mortgage whilst having an outstanding personal loan.","Hey all, pretty much what the title says.

I have a personal loan outstanding for about £7k the final payment is Feb 2021. I'm currently saving up to buy my first house, aiming to have the rest of my deposit and start buying by the middle of next year.

So that's means I'll be applying for a mortgage whilst I still have my personal loan. I've been toying with the idea of extending it and reducing the monthly amount as I currently pay £370 a month for it.

That would allow me to save quicker and I'm hoping a lower monthly outgoing will look better to a mortgage provider.

t3_bynub2,Employer stopped paying consistently; what do,"My employer, who I’ve been working under for two months, has always been pretty consistent with payment. Direct deposit into my checking account at the end of the week. 

In the last month or so, I noticed that pay was getting inconsistent. I’d be getting paid for four days work despite working a full work week. I’m young and a bit awkward, and didn’t want to make a fuss about it or taint my employer’s view of me. The past two weeks, however, have been absolute hell, because I haven’t been paid at all for my work. My employer gave me a check two weeks ago that bounced after I deposited it via my bank’s app. What’s more, I tried cashing the check at the employer‘s bank, and they said it couldn’t be done because it had already been deposited, despite the deposit bouncing back.

I haven’t been paid at all, check or direct deposit, this week either. I called my employer’s office on Friday and was told that the issue would be ‘looked into’  and that I’d get a response by the end of the day, which didn’t happened. 

What’s going on? What can I do? I’m panicking right now because I was supposed to pay off one of my student loans this week, but I haven’t enough money to do so.

t3_bynpqj,Looking for advice about buying a house straight out of college,"I’ll be graduating next spring and was planning to move to an area where I can find a good paying job and rent for a few months before buying a house. Not entirely sure on the area yet but was hoping to be in the southeast US (South Carolina, Georgia, etc).

Some background on me and my current financial situation:

-	I’ll be graduating with no debt
-	Currently have a car that should be able to last me at least 5 years before it starts having any “major” issues
-	I’ll have about $10,000 saved by the end of the summer and will probably work next semester during college
-	I’m expecting to receive about $5-$15k from my dad to help towards a down payment upon graduation
-	Houses in the area I was hoping to move to (suburb outside of Charleston) are in the $150-300k range
-	I have a friend in the area who I might rent out to if they stay interested in that
-	Jobs that I’ve been seeing in various areas that I’d probably be able to get pay around $50-75k a year
-	Depending on circumstances I could also continue my current photography business wherever I move to which could bring in an additional $10k a year in a busier city setting
-	By my understanding and calculations, this amount of income (~$60,000 a year or $5k a month) would support a mortgage payment of $1,400 a month (**correct me if I’m wrong there, I heard it was about 30% of monthly earnings**)

After talking to my parents, I’ve found they both have differing opinions regarding my plan. My dad, who makes $300k a year and has rented for the last 9 years for reasons I don’t know, thinks it’s dumb for me to be thinking about buying a house. My mom, on the other hand, who has a degree in accounting so I’m guessing she knows some things about finance, thinks that if that’s what I wanna try to do then it makes sense financially as a form of healthy debt. 

I mostly just wanna know if the general idea of buying a house is ridiculous for me or not.

If anyone has any advice I’d greatly appreciate it as I really don’t know what I’m doing yet. Thanks!",1

I'm a SAHM to two disabled adult kids, and my husband works.  By the time we pay bills and get groceries,  there's nothing left.

They finally asked me to go for 6 months and they want me there relatively soon. However, they asked me what my living situation is and if I can sublease my current apartment or put my stuff in storage while I'm there. I verified with my boss that they won't be paying for my housing (the cost of living there is slightly below where I live now) and it doesn't really sound like they will be giving me any sort of stipend either (although this has not been completely verified).

I talked to a couple friends and have gotten conflicting answers from ""sounds normal"" to ""wtf are they smoking.""

I would love to go, but I am thinking of a million little costs that are going to add up: putting my car in storage, having to eat out more (I doubt furnished apartments come with all the kitchenware I am used to using), extra costs for cell phone and gym, taking public transit or renting a car, etc. I'm already underpaid at this place, but there are various reasons I stick around. 

I think I'm going to do some more research and go back to them next week with a number I will need in order to do this (likely rent + a couple hundred/week as a stipend).

I don't have money to pay the med bills without draining the checking account needed for rent and utilities. Here are my options for the medical bills:

1. Put most of the smaller bills on a credit card and make the minimum payment to avoid going to collection. call the billers of the larger bills and ask for a payment plan and make those payments on the same credit card. Use the credit card to buy time till my wife can get back on her feet.

I've recently been given a lot more responsibility at work (last 2 months) running crews, solving problems, organizing jobs. Basically making the transition from laborer to foreman. My pay has not been bumped to reflect this.

For example I'm running maintenance and protection for a job we're on now so a sub can do some work, when I asked for the road restrictions I was told the sub had them, the sub wound up asking me what the restrictions were several times. I went ahead and got the restrictions from the state DOT, and we got it figured out.

So I've decided that 3 months in enough being foreman without foreman pay, if it hasnt been offered to me by next month I'm going to ask for it.

I've got a list of a number of things I've done on my own that have saved a lot of money and man hours, and that would have otherwise been over looked. For example we're responsible for M+P on this job, and once the structure on the job goes up we're responsible for grounding it and fitting hand hole covers. I found this out from a super that had recently left, and confirmed it by looking at the contract, my company is notorious for forgetting things like this. I went ahead and got extra handhole covers from a job that is complete, grounded the structure, and installed the handhole covers. This saves us having to go to this site again, saves about 30 man hours, saves 4 hours wear and tear on bucket trucks, crash trucks, pickups etc, and thus saves us from sending a crew 2 hours away for a 6 hour shift (we work 10s). Is it bad form to bring things like this up durring negotiations? Obviously I want to point out concrete black and white ways that me running crews results in more money made, and less time lost.

t3_bylng7,Help setting up a ROTH IRA for new job.,"GF just got a new job and we've been going over a few of the details regarding compensation. Her new job offers up a slew of benefits but one thing I noticed was there is no 401K contribution match. Given that there is no match, I got to thinking that a ROTH IRA might be better here for her as she can put up to 6 grand away a year and satisfy a reasonable amount of income percentage to savings yearly.

t3_byllha,Can I/Should I refinance used car right after purchasing?,"My wife and I needed a second vehicle. We decided to pick up a 2016 ford fusion SE for around ~15k. To get the online price we needed to finance through the dealership and we ended up leaving with a 4.7% rate. My understanding is that auto rates have been going up the past few years but I still can't stop thinking that 4.7% is way too high. 

1) Would it be worth it to try and refinance the vehicle within the first month of purchasing? 

2) Credit Scores only count one hard inquiry when you shop around for loans within a month. Is that still true even if I opened up a loan? For example; if i have two hard inquiries on Monday, took out a loan on Tuesday, and then did another hard inquiry on Friday to refinance would all three inquiries be counted as one?

3) Since the rates are already high, would it even matter if I saved a percent? We don't plan on keeping this car for more than 5 years.",1

t3_bylc2m,First check-in with HR tomorrow about career development as a young professional - Any advice?,"Hello r/PersonalFinance!

Tomorrow I have a check-in with my HR Manager for the first time since the start of my employment about a year and a half ago. Unfortunately, this will be the first and last of this type of meeting with their position as HR Manager as they will be transitioning down to a support role due to family reasons. In our exchanges back and forth through email I have kept the topic of discussion rather broad but most importantly of career pathways and development. I made the appointment with them rather quickly as soon as I heard the news of the changes.

Preceding this appointment I had also scheduled my first review with my project manager/project architect/supervisors and received exemplary remarks of my performance over the last year and a half which was then documented and forwarded to the VP of HR and HR Manager. However, during the review while bringing up compensation (which is handled by HR and not those I work with directly), it was suggested that I wait until I achieve licensure in my profession. I have finished half of my six exams rather quickly and am projected to finish by the end of the year.

With a little background I am hoping that r/PersonalFinance can give me some insight or advice with regard to their years of experience within their respective careers of ways I could truly benefit from the check-in and my pathway throughout my firm. The advice given to me by my supervisors was in good faith, and I believe that a raise in compensation would go much further after my licensure. However, after a year and a half with the remarks I have been given, I believe my salary should be commensurate to my experience rather than entry-level starting.

Unfortunately my firm is rather closed off in terms of moving up the ladder, and information about development is literally called “Career Pathways” and holds no actual benchmarks, just broad positive qualities that every employee should hold. My supervisors had even mentioned that during their asks for raises in the past using information of salary in the current industry, it was met with the fact that the firm had their own benchmarks about compensation with years of experience and title. However, only HR and higher level management know. 

I am not entirely hungry for a raise that is needed immediately, but I would like to lead this conversation to the understanding that I am intending for a larger raise with my licensure and then 2 years of high performance that has been documented by my supervisors. I want to make sure that this information is passed to the new HR Manager who is the person I would be having this conversation with in the future. Does reddit have any further advice on how to bring this forward or am I going about this in the wrong way? Thank you!!",1

Instead of focusing on your score you should be working to improve your overall financial situation.

Pay off your debts.      

Never be late on a payment.

t3_byl4qc,"I have two loans, one with 6% interest and no significant uncapitalized interest, and one with 5% interest and a significant amount of interest that will capitalize soon. How should I spend ~$1,000 to minimize my lifetime loan costs?","**TLDR:** Loan A has 5% interest and ~$1,000 (and growing) in currently-uncapitalized interest that will capitalize at the end of my grace period in six months. Loan B has 6% interest and is already in repayment, so has minimal outstanding interest. To which loan should I put the $1,000 I have available right now to minimize my overall lifetime costs?

I'm a recently-graduated student, and have two student loans. The first has a 5% interest rate and ~$1,000 (and growing) in interest which will capitalize in six months, and the other has a 6% interest rate which has already entered repayment (and thus has minimal uncapitalized interest at any given time). I have ~$1,000 to put towards loan repayment in general, so which loan should I put my money towards to minimize my total loan expenses?

In general, I understand that, once minimum payments are made to all loans, the most efficient way to put extra money towards loan repayment is to put it to the HIGHEST-interest loan first. However, in a recent message sent to me by the lower-interest loan servicer, I was told (paraphrased): ""You have ~$1,000 in currently-uncapitalized interest. If you pay off this interest before the grace period ends, you'll save ~$600 over the lifetime of the loan, and your monthly payments will be $15 smaller than they otherwise will be if you decide to let the interest capitalize."".

As this lower-interest loan is managed federally, its servicer often sends me statements including advice, in which the phrase ""Pay off your highest-interest loans first"" features prominently. But this older advice isn't mentioned here, and this suggests to me that they're trying to say that I could save more money by preventing this interest from capitalizing rather than paying off whatever loan (federal or otherwise) has the highest interest rate.

I currently believe that the most efficient move would be to put all my available money towards the loan with the higher interest rate. It's really just that little omission of previous advice that's making me second-guess myself and think I'm missing something. It's entirely possible that I'm overly cautious with finances and that I'm needlessly reading into nothing.

Nonetheless, I think it would be wise to get a second opinion so I can be certain my current plan of action is actually the best for me. Should I put my money towards the higher-interest loan, or prevent a bunch of uncapitalized interest on a lower-interest loan from capitalizing?

Thanks in advance for the help.",1

* My Mortgage is $2650/mo
* I have a roommate who pays $1250/mo in rent
* My income is about $120k this year (I'm freelance so it fluctuates a lot)
* My house is my only debt @ interest rate of 4.125%
* I owe $410,000 on the house
* Looking to take at least a couple months off of work to collect myself / re-align.
* Already have a maxed out Roth IRA
* I have a $40k emergency fund + $40k in a money market

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is I'm still receiving about $200k from back pay and miscellaneous things. So I'm trying to figure out what to do with that while giving myself enough breathing room to take a much needed break from work.

&amp;#x200B;

My idea was to recast my mortgage, I think my lender told me if I recast for $200k my mortgage drops about $1000/mo, so basically my monthly bill for housing would reduce to $400/mo.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this the right way to go, though? Should I be investing some of this new money? I'm very risk adverse. And while taking time off work it seems very appealing to only have to pay $400/mo for housing.

t3_byknn8,Moving to the US but rent is crazy where my job is,"Hey all,

I'm jumping the gun a little because I like to always have a plan in life to make the best decisions possible. That said, back story is I'm a Canadian and I may be getting a job in Boston. It's not guaranteed to pan out yet but I want to make sure I have some idea of my situation before it becomes too late

First potential job out of school. The salary range I was told is between 80k-100k a year. Now, my options for renting are a bit hard to figure out. I know there is public transit in the area but it seems it's not that great if you're not on a very thin line and if you're even a little outside the city the commute becomes long. I'm trying to avoid more than a 30 min commute to work every day if possible. 

I've done a fair bit of digging into rental prices and holy shit it's expensive. Job is in cambridge and in the city you can expect $2300-$2800 or more for a 1 bedroom. Some of these can be a 3 min walk to my work. Groceries on the other hand might be a bit of a walk to public transit to get to. I'd take a studio but my girlfriend is coming with me. She doesnt have a job lined up but she works in the same field as me so I dont think itll be too hard to get one with the abundance of opportunity around. Then she could get a TN visa and help with costs which would make things so much easier. But for the time being I'm going to be supporting us both on one income so that's my base for any living calculations. 

I do not currently own a car. So I'm going to assume for the first few months I wont have access to one because I dont want to jump the gun on a piece of shit. Or maybe it is possible to find a car easily and quickly when just moving somewhere? Either way with a move like this I just dont see getting one in a timely manner if I have to commute feasible. So in saying that I think I need to be close to my job. I did look for 20-30 minute driving commutes and even then rent is like $2100-$2400 so it's not even that much different unless I'm mistaken

As an aside I've been using public transport for years now and I hate it so much. I also was planning to play in a hockey league in the winter and its really late at night so I think eventually I'd need a car regardless just for that. As an afterthought, anyone living in this area know what the parking and/of driving situation is like in this city?

Last couple things, should I hire a realtor or something to help? Someone mentioned that more than once to me about this area and I dont know if it's worth it. The next thing is credit history. As far as I'm aware mine will not transfer so how much of a problem will this be? Also for my girlfriend with no work and no TN visa until then, she'll just basically be ""visiting"" me so she cant get a credit card or open a bank account I dont think and no money so this might be problematic. Is there a better way to go about that? I've also heard I may need up to 3 months rent on hand as well to rent here and I have almost no money since I'm out of school...

My main question is, would I be able to support myself and my girlfriend with my salary at the low end? At the high end? What's the most I'd want to pay for rent. I know theres rules about 30% max gross salary on rent and stuff. It's looking like even with my income that wouldnt be possible and I want to save well for retirement and a down payment in the future. Im hoping she can get a job quick but if it never pans out 6-8 months down the road or more I want to be financially responsible. Any advice from anyone is appreciated. Any advice from some Bostonians about the area is also really appreciated. Sorry this was so long",1

Pretty much the title. I’m 21 years old and graduated college debt free. I worked as a teller through college so I understand the importance of saving and investing while young.

t3_bykjyh,Is there anything wrong with my plan for a personal loan for a car?,"Hi all.

My car broke down catastrophically. Isn't worth fixing - have had it for years and it's a piece of junk (1998 Civic). Bad timing, though, as I just recently graduated college and moved across the country so I only have $3000 in my e-fund.

 I was thinking of getting a personal loan vs a car loan for my next car. Here's my thoughts, and please tell me if I'm wrong or not considering something:

-I am going to get a cheaper car, and the minimum car loan I can get that I can see is ~$5000

-If I buy a ~$5000 car, I'll probably go the craigslist route vs dealers because I can get a better deal

-If I get a car loan, I can't pay cash for a car. Most craigslist sellers are wary of checks even official from USAA

-If I get a car loan, I'll have to have full-coverage insurance. It looks like the rate I'd get for ~$5000 is 8%. Full coverage insurance is about $85 a month more, even for a random mid 00's Accord.

-If I get a personal loan, I can use cash (right?), and won't need full coverage insurance. It looks like the rate I'd get is ~8%. No early payoff fees.

-I will be able to pay the loan off over less than 6 months (with ease - making $65,000 a year with only $13,000 in student loans and $1200 rent) so interest will be negligible 


I'm in the South, so public transit isn't realistic or I'd just do that a few months while I save up. I don't want to tap into my emergency fund for this. I don't want to spend a lot on a car because I may move in a few years to Chicago and won't need a car.",1
t3_bykeme,Been Thinking about my Transportation Costs,"Let me start off by say when i bought my current car three years ago I was a maniac with my finances. I have since payed off my debts (minus the car loan) and have been saving to buy a town home or condo close to my office (currently live with folks far away). I guess what I am saying is I still have a lot to learn but have come a long way. Now for what I came here for.

I purchased an SUV brand new in 2017. I did not put anything down but got 0% apr, i know, dumb. I love the SUV but hate the mileage. I get anywhere from 14 to 18 MPG depending on how heavy the commute is. Here in California we had a spell of $4+ fuel prices on regular which scared the bejesus out of me. I can support the payment and fuel at those prices but if those were sustained prices I would feel the need to unload the car.

This spike in fuel got me thinking about how much I spending in transportation. I am now realizing and feeling like I could do a lot better for my finances by getting rid of the vehicle and pick up a commuter car. I have read that conventional wisdom says buy a reliable used vehicle and drive it to the ground. I have built out a little spreadsheet to organize my thoughts.

What i am hoping to get some insight from you guys on is this. I am thinking of selling my vehicle, which could have north of $3500 in equity (if you call it that in a car loan), with about 32 months left, then turned around and purchase a used vehicle (CPO type) for around 15,000 (i would finance that for 36 months or less). Would this be a prudent move? Should I hold out, keep the car, and hope fuel prices don't climb back where they were? Should i dump it while i have money that I would get back, find a reasonably priced used car with good fuel economy (around 30mpg) and drive it til the wheels fall off?

The one thing i want to do is let the money talk and make the best rational decision here.

Thank you all!

2 - Do my parents owe me money? when i started up my account under their discretion, my parents told me that they would pay me £100 per month, i thought that would be very generous, but since i have not received anything, i asked them and they said they decided not to do it, i calculated the ""debt"" and it ended up in the thousands, do they owe me the money? can i try to sue them when i am old enough? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't spend a lot of money either, i am a gentlemen so most of the money i do have goes to charity, in the form of thrift finds or charity collections, i have also bought a couple of PC games and some parts for my PC aswell, so very rarely do i spend it.

Any advice, helpful discussion and tips, will be appreciated",1
t3_byhbl7,"Finance Math Sanity Check: Better interest rate is always better, right?","Hi,

I just need you guys to double check my math. So basically, I am in a situation of dealing with a student loan of $75,000 at a rate of 1.95%.

I currently do not have a lot of savings as I am pushing every extra dollar I can to my student loans. I just recently open a high yield savings account with an interest rate of 2.25% with Marcus.

I am debating between maxing out my student loans or paying the minimum and contributing the excess to my savings. Is it my understanding that $1000 would benefit more in my savings since 2.25% &gt; 1.95% ? 

Any advice or thoughts will be appreciated

t3_byk7z4,Question about Personal Loans,"So, I'm using a throwaway account because a lot of friends and family know my real one, and I don't want to deal with explaining if they find this post out. Having said that, here's my question:

&amp;#x200B;

Through the last 7-8 years, I have accumulated a substantial Credit Card debt (around $15k), this was done mostly because I had difficulty getting jobs that could support me. I ended up having to use the CC to pay a few months of rent, then about 2-3 moves. I know this sounds crazy, but honestly, had I not used the CC, I would not be where I am today (stable job, ready to pay down this debt). 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I am using a budget and sticking to it. Already paid off two of my smaller credit cards (limits of $700 on both) and have the two big baddies left. One has about $1k and the other has the remaining $14k. Following the budget I set for myself and not having any crazy events happening, I should pay them off by 2021. They are high interest rate at 21% I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would it be worth it exploring a personal loan, at a 5-13% rate for the entire amount and pay it that way? As crazy as this might sound, my Credit is quite good if we are to believe the FICO scores these cards offer. It has been bouncing between 720 and 740. So, should I apply for a personal loan, pay off the credits cards, and go with that or should I stick to my budget the way I have been going?",1
t3_byk7dz,A few self-employed/contractor tax questions,"Hi,

I'm looking for just some general guidance, as this year is the first time I've worked both a FT job as an employee and as a contractor on the side.  I currently work a FT job where I am an employee of a company, my taxes are withheld and I receive a 1099 annually.  Traditionally, I've used TurboTax to file my taxes on an annual basis.

In March of this year I started doing some very limited contract work outside of my normal job, where my taxes are not withheld.  I've been using Quicken-books self-employed to keep track of expenses and taxes owed.

I'm a little confused about the process by which I would file my taxes:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - I believe I am supposed to file quarterly for my contract work, but still annually for my normal FT job?  Quicken-books tells me the next quarterly filing is June 17th.  So will I just file a return for the income I've made as a contractor and not worry about my FT job until annual filing begins?  

&amp;#x200B;

2 - Does quicken calculate both federal and state taxes?

&amp;#x200B;

3 - Assuming I pay quarterly taxes on my contract work throughout the year, will my normal annual filing for my FT earnings be much more complicated if I continue to use TurboTax?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if some of these questions are stupid, it's the first time I've done this and I'm just trying to wrap my mind around all of this.",1

t3_byhigk,Should I let Merrill Edge manage my investments or do it on my own?,"So I obtained around $90k-120k ~ish to work with for my investments and I was wondering if I should leave it in their hands and pay around $1000 (almost 1%) a year to let them take care of it or could I manage it myself?

t3_byjnn0,Why are ISPs (e.g. Verizon) allowed to do a hard credit check for new service?,"As the title says, why are ISPs allowed to do a hard credit check for new service?

This seems absolutely ridiculous. I am not agreeing to take a loan from Verizon, nor am I having to sign any fixed length of contract. It’s simply internet, month to month.

I see no reason this practice exists, and plan on disputing the pull even though I agreed to it on the phone. I said I do not agree to a hard credit check, and the sales person kept saying it’s “an industry standard pull” which I guess means hard, but she wouldn’t use the “hard” or “soft” vocabulary. Which seems very deceptive to me.

[Update]

Thanks for the quick feedback!

- Individuals have pointed out its because you are paying for the service after you’ve used it. 

This still seems ridiculous to me, as they should offer a monthly pre-pay to avoid any credit impact. Unnecessarily impacting a customers credit score is a bad business practice if you ask me.

- I’m also surprised as to how many folks have sided with the ISPs? You’d think there would be more rally from the people haha...

[Update 2]

My worry and argument here, isn’t over the impact to my credit score.

It’s the precedence policies like this set. That could undermine and have a negative impact on the already weakened credit score system.

Imagine a world where every service you sign up for requires a hard check. This is an invasion of privacy, as companies could use information they gleam from this to target marketing to you better. What if Netflix, Hulu, HBO, or any paid service required a hard inquiry.

Letting ISPs do this sets the playing field for other “service providers” to start making it a requirement.",1
t3_bya0w4,How I Came to Personal Finance,"Hi All,

I wanted to share my story of how I came to this sub and my circumstances. If you are reading this, please take the concepts from this sub and start applying them to your finances. If you ever manage to get to a good job like I do, you will need the knowledge to make use of the large salary you get. Not all debt problems are solved by having a larger salary, although it definitely doesn't hurt. 

Here is my story:

I've always been good at making enough money to cover any bills or debt I had, but terrible at keeping it. When I was in high school I was making $15 an hour at a time when most of the people I knew were making $7-8. I had a nice Audi and I never missed a payment for it or the large insurance I had to pay to keep it. I always managed to rack up credit card debt, but never to the point that I could not pay it. After college I would take a second job to pay my bills if I needed to. I made around 40k per year after college with a few jobs. I increased my credit card debt. I kept managing to keep my monthly bills paid, but I never really manged to pay any of the cards off altogether. I rationalized that I would do it some day when I had a higher paying salary.

Years later I finally hit my big break at work and negotiated what I considered at the time to be a huge salary. I had to relocate across the country with my family, but we all decided to give it a shot. My wife and I bought a huge house, she had brand new cars and we shared everything. Then, my father passed away suddenly and I inherited a large lump sum life insurance payment. I had no debt except for the house and car payments. Life was great.

About a year into my new life my wife and I divorced, and it was an ugly one. My 401k was drained out and by the time I managed to get the house sold, I was in debt for around $50,000. The divorce put me in a terrible position and I did what I had always done to make sure my bills were paid on time each month, and they were. My credit had no late payments. In the end I managed to pay down about half the debt I had built up from the divorce and started to rebuild my life.

A few years later I was picked up by a new company and my salary was now over the six figure range. I had to relocate again, but I was single and had a huge salary. What could go wrong? It was an easy decision. 

When I arrived in my new job and city, I found the cost of living was about 30% higher than where I lived before. I had done some basic math and could cover the expenses no problem. I stopped really paying my debt down and went back to my old ways of buying what I wanted under the idea that I always pay my bills, and I can just pay down the debt later when the next big break comes. I never budgeted anything beyond my next pay check. 

A year later I was pondering my life. I had all these bills and it felt like I had no money. I couldn't understand it. My debt had been about the same from when I relocated, $25,000, my salary was huge and I lived in a small 1-bedroom apartment. How could it possibly be that I felt like I was not earning much more than when I was in high school paying for my expensive car? I didn't have a nice car, I didn't have nice clothes, so what gives?

I started really looking at my situation. I found this sub, I read everything, and I started using a budget program (YNAB). I found that I was eating out nearly every day, multiple times. I had a fancy computer and was spending a lot of money on games that half the time I didn't even play much. I was spending tons of money on expensive alcohol. I had 3 credit cards, and a truck loan to pay off. Two of those credit cards had 25% interest rates (more or less). I couldn't believe it. I had these 3 cards for probably 10 years and I never once bothered to look at the interest rate. It's been about 4 months since then and I've nearly paid off one of the 25% interest cards, my truck will be paid this month and then I'll tackle the next 25% card.

I then started looking at my high salary and after reading through a lot of the posts and wiki here and other similar subs  I realized how much of my salary is being fruitlessly wasted to taxes. My company has a 401k that I can only put in 5% to right now because of my debt. My company also has an HSA plan that I'm only contributing a little bit to. I have no IRAs, nothing. 

My ""huge"" salary is going to credit card interest, loan interest and Federal/state tax withholdings. It's insane. I had no idea how much I have been losing over the years. I don't even want to know how much money in my lifetime I've just given away to interest or taxes. Money I could have been using towards savings or retiring early. 

I've learned my lesson and I plan to pay off the remainder of my debt, save up about 6 months of essential bills and then really start investing my money into 401k, IRAs, HSA and go from there. 

Thanks for reading my story.

Apparently, this was not caught on inspections, and now we’re afraid that we’ll be paying to get it fixed or replaced, if it comes to that. Is there anything we can do?

t3_byj59q,Confused about changing Tax Codes,"I'm a UK student in University and as a way to subsidise what little maintenance loan I receive, I work a part time Job over the summer. This position is minimum wage and I don't work the hours required to meet anywhere near the £11k or so required to start contributing PAYE as part of my payslip.

Up until now, my part time jobs beforehand have all been under a specific tax code 1185LM1, but as of this tax year, my tax code has changed (Without notice) to 39T. I have a vague understanding of what these mean but am unsure about what has changed to mean I can only earn a small amount before paying PAYE tax on my payslip. I realised this when I saw I was paying tax on a payslip of &lt;£300 and had only earned another £60 or so this tax year.

What is the best way to proceed with this; Do I need to contact HMRC and explain that I've overpaid tax? That the tax code has changed? Or do I wait to fill in a tax refund when it is due? As a student, none of this has really been explained well to me yet",1

t3_byc3lb,Cancer diagnosis for single income family (US),"Well the worst of the worst just happened. I'm two months into a new job and I just found out I have cancer that needs treatment. The difficulty is I'm the sole breadwinner. My wife is a SAHM and doesn't have a career before that aside from occasional childcare or retail. Her career prospects don't look like they would support us if I stopped working.

To make matters worse we just moved cross country and purchased a condo. Our mortgage is around 2000/month. 

Chances are highly likely I won't be able to work when chemo treatments get intensive. Which it looks like they will. 

I also have a feeling I'll be let go from my job when I start calling out excessively for not feeling well and appointments/treatments. Since I haven't been employed a year I don't qualify for FMLA 

We currently have 50k in savings. It can carry us while I get treated but if I have to go on COBRA combined with our mortgage that is going to disappear quickly.

Aside from my health I'm terrified for my financial outlook. COBRA ain't cheap. My wife has family out here who I'm sure would take us in if it came down to it but they don't really have room to fit us in their house. My father has a house with room for us to live back east. I'm sure he would ask for maybe utilities at the most. The difficulty is if we do move back east I will definitely have no insurance where I could roll the dice and see if I can somehow work and continue to get treatment. From everything I've read of the cancer I have I don't know how likely this is I can continue working. 

So my options are move back east where even if we needed to get COBRA on what we have saved we can afford two years of it into a not optimal living situation but we will definitely have financial security. Or stay on the west coast and roll the dice on me staying employed. 

To complicate matters I just bought this property. It's in a hot enough market I can turn it over and break even or lose a few thousand after closing costs. But what I would get back is probably 10k, making our full assets 60k. 

I do have good job prospects back east from former employers who would take me back in a heartbeat. But they might not have open benefitted positions available immediately. Chances are I could find a job as soon as we moved back east but I'd be in the same situation again, having to go on leave or not working at all once I get too weak. I still wouldn't qualify for FMLA. And there's a chance I won't have insurance immediately. 

It's a hard decision because right now I have insurance but I'm not sure how long that's going to last. To complicate matters I think I'll need to start treatment immediately so I have to decide soon.

My cell phone number was ported out to T-Mobile without my approval. Now, I was really confused. I logged into my bank account and I was shocked to see a withdrawal of $989.00 to Brian Santiago. I immediately reported the incident to the bank and blocked the account. I got a police report and submitted to the bank. Now, the bank is refusing to reimburse me. Investigator reached a conclusion that all information to get the money matched, based on that no reimbursement. I called the local police, no response, they said the investigator will contact you. I called ATT asked them to provide me the detailed report of that day so I could go to police and bank to prove to them that it was stolen by someone. ATT replied that they will provide the report only if I get an attorney. It took 30 sec for hackers to get my cell number and it took ATT 1 week to get my number back from T-Mobile. By the way, ATT is the worst mismanaged company. How could I resolve this issue? ATT is useless. TD Bank is refusing and police are to busy to pay attention to my problem.

t3_byfri9,Help with certifications while in school,"

I hope this is okay to ask here as I’m not sure where else to go- if there’s a better place to ask please let me know!

I’m currently looking for a class, certification or anything that can give me “experience” in a timely manner that can get me a better paying job while I’m still in school for Business/Finance. 

Background- I was a foreman of a landscape company for four years, making pretty decent money, but I couldn’t further my career anymore. I took an entry level office job at a good company to grow with while I continue in school. That job came with a huge paycut though, as I was having trouble getting anything without much real experience. For example, I’ve applied to a few Accounting Assistant positions, but haven’t had any luck because I don’t have accounts payable experience.. even though I know as a quick learner I would be able to do the job. 

I’m hoping I can find something to take online over the summer to help me be able to get past the issue of not having any experience to show.

t3_byfolo,Student Loan &amp; Scholarship Help for Grad School,"Hello! I am in need of some advice regarding taking out loans and finding appropriate scholarships for graduate school. 

I will be attending Arizona State University for a Masters degree in violin performance pedagogy. Because I am going into music (and esp at a Masters level) there are very few scholarships available, all of which are very competitive. Thus, I did not receive a scholarship or grant from ASU or their School of Music to help cover my tuition costs. There are not any TA or GA positions open; they were all accepted by incoming students. I am in close contact with my advising professor regarding available scholarships and assistantships. 

I have no significant savings. Most of the money I have saved will be used for my move from Michigan to Arizona. I live with my significant other who currently works full time as an assistant manager in retail and plans to continue doing so when we move to AZ. My SO will be my primary means of support while I’m in school, and I will also continue to work part time. 

As a graduate student, I am required to take a minimum of 9 credits per semester. The tuition cost for 9 credits (plus program and student activity fees) is $12,600. The tuition cost may get closer to $15,000 if I take additional credits in future semesters. The program is two years long. 

As far as financial aid, I was “awarded” a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for $10,250 and a Direct Graduate PLUS Loan for $15,799 for both 2019 and 2020 semesters. 

I would not accept both loans in entirety; I would accept the full $10,250 of the unsubsidized and $7,000 of the PLUS. $12,600 would go toward tuition and $5000 of the PLUS loan would be used for living expenses. 

I have also been searching endlessly for outside scholarships on FastWeb, Niche, Unigo, and other sites but cannot help but feel like they are not very legitimate. What are your thoughts on these sites? Are there better places to look for scholarships? 

I have been able to go this far without accumulating debt, but I currently see this as my defeat! Any financial advice is welcome. Are there any benefits, caveats, or advice you may have pertaining to accepting such loans? Is it wise to take out additional money for living expenses since I cannot work full time? And finally, where the heck can I find legitimate scholarships? 

Thank you!

t3_bygtcb,Taxable account allocation help,"Hi,

I don’t want to work too hard on my taxable account. I was thinking one of four strategies

1) vanguard 2060 target date fund

2) all vtsax

3) schwab 2060 target date index fund

4) a 3 fund portfolio with vanguard. 

I feel like the ER difference is not going to kill me.

I feel like all vtsax sounds simple enough. However, it seems risky to go all in on one fund. It’s true that the us total market has historically beat most investors but what about international funds? 

At the same time, even managing a 3 fund portfolio is time spent. Can I do automatic investments for a 3 fund on vanguard?

Any ideas on how I should deal with this? It almost sounds like target date funds are the way to go.

If I am doing a tdf, I was thinking of going with schwab target date index fund because they are tax efficient compared to mutual funds. Thoughts?


If I were to do all vtsax vs a target date fund, are the return rates that much different? 

Please note that vtsax mutual fund is just as efficient as an ETF through the viper patent that vanguard has.

Likewise, the Schwab target date index fund, not the schwab target date fund is also as efficient as an etf. They adapt a similar strategy as vanguard to make this happen where they make it a hybrid of etf and mutual fund.

t3_bygp43,58 Year Old Teacher in Need of Investment Advice,"Hello All,

I'm a 58 year old high school teacher in need of investment advice. I currently own 3 homes. In addition to my primary residence, I have a rental home that's run by a property manager. The rental income pays for the mortgage of this unit while netting me $500/month. My 2nd home used to be my primary residence. I bought a new home two months ago and moved out and have spent some time and money to renovate this home and to get it ready to list starting next week. I bought the property for $143,800. Comparable properties in the same neighborhood have sold for over $200,000. Given the upgrades and the fact that it's occupant ready, the realtor is going to list it for $234,500. 

Once I sell the house, what should I do with the money? 

I'm currently earning $64,000 as a teacher and have additional net rental income of $6000 per year for a total of $70,000.

The downside is that I don't have anything put away in investments. Since I've spent a lot of years teaching abroad and working at public schools in Arizona and Texas (which don't pay social security ), I'm not eligible for social security. 

I'm also autistic but did not learn this until I was 54. While I'm on the high functioning end of the spectrum, I've had a LOT of teaching jobs. In retrospect I now know that when I get really stressed out over an extended period, my flight of fight response kicks in and I leave. The end result is that I'm only vested in Nevada (6 years experience) and Arizona (6 years experience). I'm not vested in Texas because I cashed out my state pension to pay for culinary school. (I was an elementary teacher for 17 years and after burning out, I took a year off to go to culinary school. After working in the food service industry for 5 years, I returned to education 12 years ago as the chef instructor of a high school Culinary Arts program.)

Assuming my body holds out until I'm 72, I'll have a nominal 20 y ear pension through my district if I can work for 14 more years. I realize that I should invest the money I'll make from the sale of the house but I don't know whether I should be conservative and go with CDs or fixed annuities or whether I should put my money into a mutual fund. 

My father has told me not to worry because he says that I will inherit his multimillion dollar fortune. I personally don't believe this because he's willing everything to my stepmother who is supposed to will everything to me when she passes. The problem is that she hates me (the feeling is actually mutual) and although my father would like me to inherit after she passes (since she has no children), I know that this is legally unenforceable. 

Assuming he passes first and she inherits, once she inherits all of my father's assets will be hers.

I am therefore doing some late contingency planning because I'm not going to have social security and will need something to supplement my retirement income. 

I have thought about finding a significant other to help share expenses (and income) but since I am a reclusive introvert when I'm not at work, I don't think this will happen. A few years ago I joined a dating site for singles over 50.  I had a few dates but nothing really happened until I learned that I was autistic. Once I updated my profile to say that I was autistic, OMG ... six women contacted me. I know that I should have been thrilled but my response was to panic. I immediately terminated my membership and never read any of the emails that I received.  As the character Matthew Cuthbert observed in Anne of Green Gables, when asked why he had never married he said, ""Before you can court a woman, you have to talk to her."" 

I would be grateful for any constructive suggestions regarding how to invest the money I will earn from selling my home.",1

It is so difficult to that total amount each month.

The rest of this this post is to review my financial situation.

After graduating, I transitioned from a position on the main university campus to the medical campus (a big leap to help me down the road to attend medical school). The position pays a $39,500 annual salary, and I take home $2,355.21/mo after payroll deductions and taxes.  

-- health insurance: $40.88/mo

Currently, I have a:

2. Bank of America saving's account ($300.00)


3. Ally high-interest saving's account ($2,000.00) -- 2.20% APY

t3_byfz7v,Appealing a BofA Account Shutdown or dealing with collections?,"I opened a BoA account a few days ago and had to make an initial deposit to fund the account.

I told the Banker that I didn't have cash on me but would transfer funds into that account and I did so on the same day I opened the account.

Unfortunately for me, I made an extremely stupid mistake on the Chase interface after verifying my BofA account with them. Instead of ACH pushing the money, I ACH pulled the money from the BofA account. This resulted in an overdraft on the BofA account when the transaction went through 2 days later.

I noticed this one way after the transaction posted (so, 3 days since I opened my account) when my account was still active and called the hotline to speak to an associate about this. I was still able to login my account then to see the $35 overdraft fee + $1500 negative balance. However, while waiting for the phone call, the account was flagged and shut down. When calling risk, you get the usual reply of ""closed for business reasons and no way to appeal"" reply and the occasional rude agent.

I tried calling the banker that opened the account for me but he just told me there's nothing he can do to assist once its flagged by risk. BoA also claims that they've managed to retrieve the $1500 from Chase and I only owe them the $35 overdraft fee but as of today, I still see it in my Chase account.

They also told me that the only way to pay the overdraft fee is to walk into a physical branch, however, this is physically impossible as I just left the US and won't be back for a period of time to settle that ""debt"". I highlighted this to everyone I spoke to at collections trying to get the fee waived, but everyone just says BoA may report you to Chex and EWS and there's no way to pay overwise. I tried getting a supervisor to speak as suggested by someone from the Risk Department but haven't heard back so far.

Yes, I acknowledge that it was a stupid mistake on my part but that's already a done deal. I've also tried looking for the ""executive"" lines that were seemingly around in 2018 but they all seem to have been disconnected :).

Anyone has any idea how this will negatively impact my current checking/credit accounts with other banks? Or is there an avenue for me to highlight this to someone at BoA who can actually review the situation as I'd actually, well, like to do business with them.",1

I’ve been aggressive and owe $27,700 with the maturity of the loan being 9-1-2032. I used some savings to go toward the principal a while back. 

I really do enjoy the “peace of mind” idea of owing nothing. I understand there will always be payments to make but that’s just going to the case.

t3_byfpkx,Investments for my Asian mother-in-law,"My wife is from Taiwan and in Taiwan these do this thing where children are expected to pay back their parents when they are adults and start having their own income.  While its not something we typically do in the USA, I think its a rather sweet idea  and I support the idea of supporting her mom financially as she gets older.

....However, my mother-in-law is terrible with money. She likes to invest, but doesn't like to hang on to her investments so she ends up constantly losing her money.  With that, us giving her a part of our income (culturally, I feel like it is her right as a parent to get this) feels a lot like enabling a gambler.

Here is my thought process so far, and I would really appreciate advice as I am a little out of my depth here. I was thinking, as my mother-in-law is currently 55, working and earning an income and will likely retire when she is 65, perhaps I could invest that money that would normally go directly to her.

(I want to point out that I am not trying to withhold anything from her. My mother-in-law and I have a great relationship and I would not do any of this without getting her full support and approval) 

1. Could I set up an account in my name and somehow transfer her ownership in 10 years? Or would I need to set up some sort of joint brokerage account? If yes to any of these, will there be any sort of ramifications I need to be aware of with me being a US citizen and her being a Taiwanese citizen?
2. What sort of investments would you suggest for this time frame? I personally currently invest in VXUS and VTI  for myself, but I have around 30 years before retirement so I don't know if that would be a good option for someone who is retiring in 10. I am thinking maybe a bond ETF or something. Can anyone here suggest something for me to look into?

How bad of an idea would it be to stop saving for retirement at that point (except for maybe whatever my company 401k match is or a few grand here and there) and instead use that money to aggressively save up as much money as possible for a house? I live in a very high cost of living so good houses here are at least $400k, but I want something around $600k+ in my early thirties.

*I’m not sure if this is worth mentioning or not, but I do have a student checking account with my bank.*

1) I once heard someone say that there’s a “tier” to getting cards. I.E. you can’t get an AMEX * Ritz-Carlton points card as your first card. Is this true, false, or...?

2) If 1 is false, I was planning on getting a Hilton rewards card being that I travel a lot. Do points ever expire and (more importantly) would someone with a student checking account (me) be declined from getting a points/rewards card?

3) My bank, while it is small (2-3 dozen branches statewide), they do offer a credit card. Would I only be able to get my card through them or could I get my card(s) through other card distributors?

4) No matter what card I end up getting, do all cards have an autopay feature? (I hope that’s the proper term. For instance, if I bought something for $100 with my card, would said amount be deducted from my checking account?)

Thanks for the help, everyone!",1
t3_byc5sl,Do credit unions verify/prove eligibility or do they just take your word for it?," 

I joined UWCU (University of Wisconsin Credit union) a credit unon based out of Wisconsin obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

So I live in a house with my older sister and her boyfriend in the Minneapolis, MN area. Her boyfriend is from Wisconsin and most of his family is living in Wisconsin. I actually learned of UWCU from him even though he has never banked there or been a member before but has told me he has friends who do and they highly recommend them.

It says specifically on their eligibility page "" As a Wisconsin resident, if you’re currently enrolled at or have previously attended any accredited institution of higher education anywhere across the country, you’re eligible for membership. "" Well most of my sister's boyfriend's family in Wisconsin has attended college at one point in their life, which makes them eligible and thus makes my sister's boyfriend eligible, because immediately family members of those eligible are eligible to join.

[https://www.uwcu.org/about-us/membership-eligibility/](https://www.uwcu.org/about-us/membership-eligibility/)

Now it says below "" Persons of the same residence maintaining a single economic unit "" So since I live in the same house with my sister's boyfriend who is eligible, that makes me eligible as well.

On the application I just selected the "" Immediate relative or household member of any eligible person "" and the application was instantly approved, my accounts were funded and I got the online banking setup.

So are they actually going to ""verify"" my eligibility at all, or just take my word for it on the application? Is there a chance that they lock accounts until it gets verified or if they suspect something? (The fact I have a Minnesota address I think would pop out to them) What kind of documentation would I need to verify all of this anyway? Because they would not only need to verify not my eligibility, but my sister's boyfriend eligibility as well since I used the person living in the same household option, and also need to verify one of my sister's boyfriend's immediate family members living in Wisconsin.

I was expecting after I submitted the application it'd say they'd contact me to get more information from me. The fact everything was approved and ready to use kind of surprised me.

It is not my intention to fraudulently join or lie about my eligibility. I wouldn't of applied if I wasn't eligible.",1

t3_bxoy3e,My fiancé just got unexpectedly fired today and we're both now reminded why r/personalfinance is always insisting on trying to live off one income.,"We were both blindsided by today. We're both pretty young, early on in our careers, he had only been there a year and was performing. It was a huge shock. We don't practice every best habit of the sub but we're grateful we picked up doing your best to live off one income.

We just bought our house in August and insisted on going through the pre-approval process off my income alone.  Our lights will stay on because our bills are effectively scaled to one income as well. We held off on car payments and continued to drive our beaters because the numbers for new used cars didn't make sense with one income.

My only regret is not building up our emergency fund more (one month saved but we should've had at least three), so if you're reading this, definitely do that.

Anyways, thanks to the sub for the constant advice on living below your means and always being prepared. I came to thank you all, not lecture. And encourage people who are following this thought process and are using a second income for the ""extra stuff"" - you're doing great. Today sucked but it could've been so much worse.

We're counting our blessings and the job search begins tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the encouragement and well-wishes. This obviously isn't the only thing going on in our lives, so the messages to keep going were greatly appreciated. 

For those of you who are in HCOL areas or other situations where living off one income isn't possible, I totally understand - the intent of this post wasn't to shame anyone into anything. We live in a MCOL city in the South and are in the tech sector so it was doable for us. We're also not beacons of perfection of this sub and are still working on breaking bad financial habits every day. 

For those of you who took this as a self pat-on-the-back post, I can see that. The intent really was to see the silver lining of things and encourage others who are perhaps considering this type of budgeting method. But I understand how fast this sub gets into circle-jerking and self-congratulating and didn't mean to purpose this thread for that. Just hoping to reduce the amount of ""We're in deep shit from one event that could've had a much lower impact"" posts by showing anything can happen at any time and that even then, we weren't as prepared as we should've been.",1

t3_byf4xx,How to transfer banks efficiently?,"I’m in the process of trying to switch from Bank of America to Navy Federal, but I’m hitting some hiccups. I have a credit card with BofA, at this point close to maxed out at almost $2000 in debt. It’s not a huge deal to me right now, I can have it paid off in 2 months easy. But the only way to pay it is through transfer from my BofA checking account. I would really like to be able to close the bank account and cancel the credit card as soon as that card is paid off. However, I just ended a car lease and my credit score dropped 50 points. I’m now very worried about closing that account. It’s my second oldest credit card, so my average credit history would drop. And apparently you can lose credit points just for closing an account? It’s VERY important to me to have my score over 700 by February next year. It was at 700 before it dropped when I closed my lease. I need to get another car lease in February and I’m worried I won’t get good options if my credit is under 700. 

I’m considering opening a new credit card through Navy Federal, with a 0% intro APR. transfer the credit, close the accounts and be done with it sooner rather than later to give my credit enough time to bounce back before I really need it again. Even if I can’t get a $2000 limit, I can transfer the max amount and pay the rest off. I just don’t want to hit my credit if I’m not going to qualify for it at all, or if this is a really stupid idea. Also, I really hate the idea of switching banks in general, and having to go through and update my payment information for everything, but I hate BofA at this point more than almost anything.

I'm thinking investments could be a good idea, but I know very little about investments at the moment.

t3_bycvhx,Need to either repair or buy a new car with bad credit and I have no idea what steps to take.,"Honestly not sure if this is a good place for this, so I'm really sorry if I'm causing trouble and would really appreciate being redirected to find help. A couple of days ago my engine blew out and now it's entirely inoperable; the only real repair would be to replace the entire engine block. The car's fully paid off and has remained in the family for its entire 17 years, but KBB rates its value (assuming the engine is fine) at around $1600. The lowest quote I've heard for the engine is around $3500.  

Most of the used cars I can look at for around the same price as the engine repair seem to be in a comparable condition to mine when operable, or nicer condition with an ambiguous ownership history. I just finished moving to a different state, so while money's tight my parent was gracious enough to offer to assist with covering the down payment or the engine cost, but the catch to it is that they get to be choosy about how it's spent. In other words, there's been an adamant refusal to look at used cars that are at risk of requiring repair over the next few years. I've tried to reason and explain that in many cases it would still remain cheaper than the engine, but it's been an immovable position. 

The biggest problem with this situation is that I've got bad credit because of some issues with student loans. At the moment it's sitting at 450, and after calling some dealerships today I'm ineligible for a lease and any purchase I could make would basically require $3500 down payment and then ~400/mo, nearly double the monthly cost of their standard finance plans for vehicles priced around $16-18k. Essentially over 6 years I'd be paying nearly twice the value of the car. Getting the loans completely taken care of is being negotiated at the moment, as I was left a trust to handle education costs that covers it, but I have no idea how much of a positive impact getting them paid off will have on my credit score, and likewise how much that would affect potential car financing or eligibility for a lease in the near future.

I do have a pretty comfortable job at the given moment, and while I could feasibly pay the higher finance rates and still be okay it would basically mean I'm completely incapable of saving for retirement for the near future. So to round it out I'm really lost, as honestly I've never dealt with credit before. I don't know what the best option is between repairing the car or getting fleeced by the interest rates offered by the dealerships. Common sense and nearly every expert tells me repairing the car is silly, but is it more reasonable to do that and keep the car going for a few years while I build my credit to get a more manageable finance for a new car? I have a temporary solution for the coming week, but being absolved of the outstanding loan balance could take until the end of the month. 

I'm totally clueless how to handle about 90% of the factors of the situation I'm finding myself in, and would really appreciate any sort of opinions or advice.",1

The CDs earn about $5/month in interest, while GS Bank is obviously a bigger amount at $25/month. That got me thinking.

Would it be worthwhile to close out the Navy CDs and put them into GS Bank so that the compounded interest is working against a higher balance of $22k? Or should I leave it all be? I realize I'll take a 3 month penalty on the CDs but they just renewed, so not sure if they'll still get me for 3 months, or just the 1 month since the renewal.",1

**Income:**  Mine ($100,000) Wife's ($50,000)  
**Credit Score:**  Mine (&gt;800) Wife's (high 700s)  
**Age:** 30s  
  
**-----Debt -----**     
**Student loans:** $50,000  
**Home:** $85,000 (looking at no more than $250,000 for our next one)  
**Vehicle:** One at $4,000, other paid off.  
**Credit Card:** zero by end of month.  
  
We both contribute to 401k, I have about 150k in mine, not sure on wife.    
  
**Savings:** $0 (recently wiped out due to recently paying off debt due to debt cleanup and family passing away across country, multiple trips cleaned us out)  
  
We got a budget in order, and after all expenses we have about $3000 a month ""free"".  This includes having paid for utilities, vehicle/mortgage/student loans, play money, food, meds, animal care the whole enchilada.  We could make a few cuts to get that number up to $3800 max, but it will hurt so short-term viable.  House is older, and needs some work.  Going to need to schedule an assessment to see what we can get out of it, but I am paranoid we won't get much or not a lot after everything is done.  The neighborhood is going south and we want to move by next year.  Repairs are going to be required to sell, we're guessing at about $5k, but it does have a new roof and siding so hopefully it doesn't sit on market forever.  My current plan is save $2k a month, leaving $1k to get repairs done over the next few months, then shift all $3k to savings.  
  
**Questions:**  
  
* I purchased the house, the wife never has purchased one.  What are our finance options?  What is the smartest move?    
* Current house is mortgaged through our Bank.  What's the best way to shop around or get a good deal?  
* Is my plan regarding repairs/saving a solid one?  
* Should I consult a realtor before doing any repairs?  
* Guides I have read said you need 20% down payment to avoid paying PMI.  That's $50,000 and we're not counting on having that much.  If we get more for the house than we're hoping then maybe, but not going to plan on that.  How bad is PMI going to hurt?  
* Having a bigger down payment is better than having lower debt, right?  So paying off the vehicle note to ""snowball"" that money into savings is not wise versus just saving the extra money, right?  Same with paying down house/student loan?

I started out making baked goods for close friends and family for free for parties and weddings. Thanks to word of mouth, I started getting more and more requests and was able to charge people. Each week was different and I never took on a lot in. After expenses, I'd be making about $200-$500 a week.

Now my clientele is backed up, I'm booked every weekend for the next 3 months and I'm making a decent amount. Anywhere from $800-$2000 a week after expenses. The extra income is great, thing is I'm now worried that I'm making too much money off of something I do from my kitchen.

I never went to culinary school, I don't know the first thing about running a bakery, food and safety (I have a really clean kitchen but still), and now I'm scared of something looming. Especially taxes. Everything has always been under the table.

Does anyone know of anyone else in my similar situation? Someone with a home cooking business that can advise me on what I should be doing? Anything helps!",1

t3_byejkt,Where to start with choosing health insurance?,"Greetings!
I am currently a bit overwhelmed with the task of shopping for health insurance and was hoping to get some advice from those who have gone through the same experience or have additional knowledge on the topic. I apologize for the lengthy post, but I hope it gives more insight into my situation. 

My background:
I am 23 years old, am a junior in college, and am employed full time as a bartender. 
Unfortunately since my employer is a somewhat small business (not a franchise or major corporation), we do not have benefits offered to us. However, it is an amazing job - offers me flexibility, my bosses are wonderful, and it works well will my college schedule. With that being said I don’t want to consider quitting to work somewhere that offers benefits because that still doesn’t seem worth it. 

For those wondering why I am not still on my parent’s insurance policy, my parents kicked me out of their home when I was just shy of 18 years old due to me stating I no longer wanted to be a part of the religious cult I had been raised in. So, while I know that would be the best option for someone my age, unfortunately it is not an option as I have no contact or relationship with my parents. 

I also recently had an employment change and is what triggered this search for insurance. I have worked at the bar for about a year, but just until two months ago I was working there on the weekends and working at Wells Fargo full time, which I had full benefits through. I had worked for WF for 4.5 years, however due to me working 60+ hours per week and also being a full time college student who is approaching the core of my major-focused learning, I knew I had to give something up as my academics were beginning to suffer. Since my major (criminal justice) is going to lead me in a completely different career path, I chose to stay at the bar and quit the bank since I would be offered a more flexible schedule and could still make great money. 

When talking to my peers, many have said “well, you don’t have any severe health problems or medication needs, why don’t you just stick it out until you graduate and get a job with benefits?” I’ve considered this, but it also scares me. I don’t want to be hit with something that might not be life or death but will still end up costing me thousands out of pocket. Also, given my career path which is law enforcement, graduating college is just the first step (In Minnesota anyhow). After that comes police academy, taking your POST test, and the grueling application process at several agencies  which usually takes months for background checks, etc. So all in all, it could be quite some time before I have a job with benefits again. 

When searching the web, I’ve been overwhelmed as well as confused on how it seems like it’s not quite that easy to just get health insurance without doing it through an employer. I also have some confusion when trying to understand what I’m actually getting with certain plans - is a high deductible better with no copay/coinsurance? Also, despite the fact that I make good money as a bartender, some of the monthly premiums seem so outrageously expensive! I have also looked into state assistance but unfortunately make too much money. 

I apologize for the rambling, but am hoping this will give a detailed picture of my dilemma. Thank you for any advice in advance! 

TLDR; 23 yr old Minnesota based college student needing help to find health insurance since she cannot be on her parents or get it through an employer and is overwhelmed when trying to shop for it online.",1
t3_byeilp,How do you read salaries on google?,"Hello, long time lurker, first time posting on reddit. I just want to thank everyone that has posted! You have helped me turn my life around almost debt free!!!

My question is, how do I read the salaries on google? 

I have been offered a position at a company and my current supervisor told me to do my research and try googling it for an estimation before sitting at the table to discuss it. I am at Glassdoor and the experience for 0-1 years it gives me a range of $39,000 - $60,000. If I change it to 1-3 years I get $52,000 - $61,000.  

I have experience running a very small (one analyzer) lab at the job before which I did everything a ""manager"" would do expect I was never given the title. My current role is a step back from the ""manager role"" and I just process samples for techs to run after me. The job I am being offered is a supervisor position that will require a move 2 hours away. I'll be running an entire shift. I only have an associate's degree but in clinical science for lab. 

I have never done research on salaries and the ranges seem so big its almost unhelpful? Is there a rule of thumb or something better than maybe Glassdoor?",1
t3_byei60,My checks aren’t showing up and I have $1k in bills coming up. What can I do?,"I’m 19, just moved into my first apartment, and I’m freaking out. 

My credit card bill of $650 (minimum payment $20) is due on June 28, rent of $409 is due July 1, and another credit card bill of $65 (minimum $20) is due on July 14th. I started a job around a month ago and set up direct deposit, but apparently it takes a few weeks to go through, so they mailed paper checks. 

I have a mail forwarding in place because I was hired before I moved into the new place. I updated my address immediately, but by then 3 of my checks were mailed to my home address and were supposed to be forwarded. Well, the checks haven’t been received at my home address or my new one, and it’s been about 3 weeks since the first one was sent. The first checks total over $600 and the following checks between now and the 28th will add up to over $1000.

What are my options if this situation is never fixed? I had to empty my accounts to pay for the deposit on this place. My credit score is around 705. I make about $300 a week (first paycheck was a training check for only $30). I just don’t know if I should scrape out the minimum payment and deal with the interest until August, when my university will issue me a large financial aid refund check, around $8,000.

If I don’t have rent in cash by July 1st, my boyfriend can loan me part of it and I can Venmo the rest to him using my credit card— resulting in me paying a 3% fee and any interest on it, but at least being able to pay rent until August.

TL;DR: my checks aren’t arriving from my job and I have bills coming up. Should I take a loan to pay things or find a different way to make the money?

I am looking at cars that cost about 22-23 thousand dollars. Is it more beneficial to make a bigger down payment but have less left over in your bank account?

I was thinking about doing 15,000 down. This of course will change based on how long my current car lasts. I’m just driving it till it dies and it could die in a month or it could last another year so I’m not sure my exact bank account payment at time of purchase. Also, I’m trying to keep in mind that monthly car payments will cause my bank account to grow slower than normal.

I know it’s $6000 a tax year, but my earnings this year will heavily outweigh my earnings next year (because my income is from an internship), so is there a way to contribute to both tax years? or am I a month too late?

I’ve never put money towards an IRA so I’m not sure what route to go. I’ve seen vanguard heavily recommended but I’ve also read some articles saying Wealthfront is a decent choice because of the “free” period of $15k (used a referral link)

I feel like I have enough money, but now it seems like it is all over the place and I get anxiety about it. I currently have the following:

Vanguard (recently moved from Franklin Templeton):

$8134 - Franklin Growth Opportunities FGRAX - regular brokerage

$2443 - Franklin Mutual Global discovery TEDIX - regular brokerage

$8691 - Franklin Growth Opportunities FGRAX - ROTH IRA Brokerage 

$2777 - Franklin Strategic Income FRSTX - ROTH IRA Brokerage

$5119 - Franklin Mutual Global Discovery TEDIX - ROTH IRA Brokerage

Navy Federal:

$2858 - Current Checking

$6000 - Money Market (emergency fund)

$3000 - Easy Start Cert. 12 month

$7000 - Certificate 10 month

$3000 - Certificate 6 month

$4000 - Certificate 9 month

Thrift Savings Plan:

$8248 - Traditional

$63653 - Roth

Credit card Debt: on 1 card, and I have 2 backups

\~$2000 (ebbs and flows, I don't always carry a balance but pay about $2000 a month. I charge almost everything here. I don't chase points, but it good to accumulate them.)

\~$2000/month expenses

&amp;#x200B;

So to start off, I started the TSP accounts and originally started traditional, but now my contributions are Roth. I believe this is classified as a 401k thing and doesn't count to my $6 Roth IRA allowance. The funds are in the riskiest currently allowed with the thought that I am far from retirement. They are 4.33% over the last 12 months. Next came Franklin Templeton. I started there from 1st Command a few years ago as I was linked up with a broker/adjuster from a friend. I started putting money away there too until I learned about how much they were charging. I thought it was a lot at the time, but maybe I was wrong. Then I was stagnant for a while. Within the lat 12 months I have opened a Vanguard account and simply held the Franklin funds there. That's basically the story. My car is paid off and I rent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here are the questions. I am about to be 34 with no wife no dependents. Am I doing okay were I am at? I just recently bought all the certificates at NavyFed because a friend brought it to my attention that $20k+ hanging out in my checking account isn't doing anything for me. I might as well make more than that 0.05%. Now I am looking at Vanguard. I would like to get rid of the Franklin holdings and move to something else. Is there any good advice on what to buy in Vanguard? I would like to just give a good stab at it with the \~$27k there. Of course I understand to deversify between low-med-high risk funds, but I am having a hard time determining this. Then after some time I wiii do some small picking and choosing. I will be roughly putting in $1k every month and waiting until accrual of 5k to pick something new. Every time I expand the info for any fund on Vanguard, I get overwhelmed. Are there some training videos that explain all the minutia or are there only a few things a beginner needs to pay attention to? If my TSP is a Roth 401k-ish fund, that means I am missing out on the Roth IRA $6000 yearly limit right? It is always better to drop this in your Roth as fast as possible vice monthly deposits, right? More investment time type of thing. 

Don't hold back if I am being a twat, because I really don't know what I am doing :/

As always, thanks for the help! This community is great.",1
t3_by8ds4,The pressure to purchase a home,"Just wondering if anyone else has ran into this during their financial journey. 

My wife and I made the decision to hammer down debts a few years ago and have paid around 80k off over the last year. All that’s left is a student loan and a car.  We recently went through a job transition and along with the job being a huge blessing it will also require us to move. The emotional dilemma we’re in is deciding between renting/buying/continuing to pay off debt etc... once the transition is over we can either use savings to knock out more debt, almost completely paying off the car, or use it as a down payment to get in a house. If we pay off debt we obviously will have to rent and stay in that position. We don’t have kids yet but being in our early 30s we both feel the pressure to “move on” from the renting phase of our lives and get into the mortgage/equity phase. I know there’s know right or wrong, and the smarter thing I THINK is to rent and keep paying off debt, but we’ve sacrificed for 2 years living with a family member and have gone without a kitchen, full bathroom, small living space just to pay off what we have and we’re just ready to move on.  Anyone else gone through feeling pressure to get into the next phase of life?

t3_bye1i1,Offered a free old car for a move to LA,"Context: I am a 22 year old recent college graduate living in Boston working as a concierge at an upscale loft building until I find a job in my career path. I am currently interviewing for two jobs in LA I would take in a heartbeat, and I think I am very likely to get at least one and move in August. I have about $10k saved for moving expenses and getting on my feet

Today at work an elderly resident who is very fond of me offered me her 1998 Toyota Corolla for free. I was telling her about how a planned on moving to LA and was stressed about having to buy a car. She basically told me owning it is an annoying at this point, and 'I'm too old to drive and I have enough money to last me until I die so I don't feel like putting in the hassle of selling it. I'd rather give it to you knowing I'm helping a young person chase their dreams'. She said the car is in good shape and very dependable, and has 130k miles on it. 

While I want to say yes, I checked on how much it would cost to move the car from Boston to LA and got quoted around $1,000. I have never driven for more than a few hours at once, let alone cross country, so personally driving coast to coast is definitely not an option. Plus what I spend on hotels, gas, food, and wasting however many days it takes probably is close to the initial $1k and I'm weary about putting that much stress on a 20 year old car. The lady told me the car was recently checked up and given an oil change, but I will still definitely have to pay to get it inspected before I take it out. I also am thinking about just taking it and selling it, however I don't have a place to store the car in the meantime, and I don't have car insurance now so I'm a little concerned about driving the car around Boston (was going to get insurance after I move to LA). Also not sure if I could even sell it at all, then I'm just stuck with an old car. If I do ship the car, a friend in LA told me he can keep it on his property for a few months until I get there.

Overall, is it worth it to pay the ~$1.5k to have this 20 old car inspected and delivered to LA, or would it be more worthwhile to wait until I get to LA and spend more money on a newer used car? I have never owned a car before having gone to college in a city, so I'm not sure what I should expect to pay for a decent car, or how to buy a car. What would you do in my situation? Also please let me know if there are important details I left out I should add. Thank you

Edit: Most of you guys are saying the best decision financially is to drive it myself. I'm **very** anxious about driving that long. I haven't driven a car in about 4 years and it's not like I can really practice driving cross country. I know I'm going to have a rough time getting used to LA highways but at least I can learn and get used to it. While im definitely open to looking into the drive, I estimated it would cost me around $400-500 with all expenses. I would like to rephrase the question to **with all things considered, is paying ~$1,000 to ship the car worth it or am I better off declining the offer, or trying to sell it and put that towards a car once I've moved**

Edit 2: Something I completely forgot about is that I have a cat I also have to take across the country. I definitely can't take her on a cross country drive, and I am 100% not comfortable with shipping her without my supervision. This makes the driving scenario a lot less likely. I'm leaning towards selling it for whatever I can get and putting that towards a new car",1

I'm told what work needs to be done, I don't have any personal equipment other than my laptop I use for printing shipping labels and that kind of thing.

I have no idea what other options to implore. I can hold off on surgery, but my condition is affecting my life quality and my doctor prefers I get the procedure done ASAP. Aside from the surgery, I get sick quite frequently and have a chronic condition that requires daily medication. I can't afford any of these services without insurance.

t3_bydtv3,Should I cancel my credit cards?,"Hello Reddit,   


I'm 18 with a credit score of 696 and I own 7 credit cards. I'm really responsible with my finances and I have never been in debt. I had a question regarding canceling credit cards.   


Credit card history:

Bank of America - 5 yrs 9 months (Credit limit of $2000) (Co)

Bank of America - 5 months (Credit Limit of $500)

Discover - 3 months (Credit Limit of $300)

Walmart - 3 months (Credit Limit of $400)

Capital One - 3 months (Credit limit of $300)

Deserve - 3 months (Credit Limit of $300)

Old Navy - 3 months (Credit Limit of $300)

&amp;#x200B;

If I close my Old navy, Capital one, and Deserve card will it negatively affect my credit score? Would you recommend keeping them?

I haven't seen the benefits  package but it includes healthcare (not sure what my contribution would  be but my guess in around $100/mo), 4 weeks paid vacation, 401K (3%  match after 1 year), personal days and a phone bill (still on my  families plan so my parents will be happy to hear that one, wont affect  me though).

I  live in Los Angeles, CA. Last year, I made $81,771 and paid 24.7% in  both federal and state taxes ($6,000 of that income came from other  clients I was able to take on). I've ran a bunch of numbers but can't  seem to get to a singular answer as to whether or not this is a better  deal than what I've been working with.

t3_bybfg3,"Relocating across the country for my job, seeking general advice and input.","Throwaway account to avoid being identified.

&amp;#x200B;

This may not be the best subreddit to raise this question/discussion. I can cut and repost if someone can point me in a better direction.

Brief background: I'm 31 with no college degree. I started working at a call center in my early 20s during a break from school. The money ended up being really good or at least better than I've ever had until that point, so the idea of returning to school withered away and I eventually moved into a position of authority at this center. I have held that position for several years now.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of days ago, the CFO of the company that owns the center offered me a job to be a director at a different center across the country. This would essentially be a coast to coast move for me (east to west), so it is obviously going to be a tremendous headache and massive source of stress, along with the job itself. But the raise is significant, 35k. This seems like it is worth doing, not just for the money, but for what it could do for my career trajectory as well. I have felt like I was treading water in terms of my role in this company for a number of years now, but this offer dramatically changes that.

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose what I'm looking for is advice from anyone else that has had to make a significant move for work, as well as any negatives that I may not be considering at this point. Considering the move is from a cold snowy temperate climate to a perpetually sunny climate and the money is significant, I may be looking at this with beer goggles. And again, if anyone thinks I should relocate this post or even just cross post it, I would love to pointed in the right direction. I'm looking for as many opinions as possible.",1
t3_bydoai,"Received notice about a “New Derogatory Account” via CreditWise, please help.","Hi, I’m a 19yo currently working to build up my credit. I have a single secured credit card from Capital One that I rarely use and was just about to break a score of 700. I’ve additionally been attending college and have not taken out loans as I was fortunate enough to qualify for enough financial aid.

I received a notice from the CreditWise application that I have a new derogatory account and my score plummeted 40 points, which is kind of heartbreaking because I have been doing everything in my power to work on building a good score.

I have absolutely no clue what this account is, but it’s in collections and shows a highest balance of $925 and a current balance of $56. The original lender listed makes me think medical charges, but I’ve never (that I can recall) even been to the ER/doctor without my parents for the specific fear of something coming up in my name.

My coworker suggested that I check my paystubs to find out if my wages have been garnished, as I’ve never payed on whatever this debt is, yet it shows a top balance of quite a bit more than what’s owed. My paystubs show no garnish.

I may just be ignorant on the topic but I’m very confused about the situation and am upset about the massive ding to my score.

I’m not entirely sure what I hope to happen or figure out, but I mostly just want my score to be back where it was. If it’s as simple as paying the $56 (I don’t even know how to do that, I’ve never received a notice/mail about this before) I’ll do it in a heartbeat and won’t risk “fighting” it.

1. I paid a few hundred dollars off my credit card, bringing my utilization to 32%

2. I lost my credit card so I had to go through the process of getting a new one.

My dad has some land that he is looking to sell. The buyer has two options so to speak. 

The first would be to pay $45,000 USD cash in one payment for the land.

The second option is to give my dad a down payment of $15,000 USD and $500 USD monthly payments for 14ish years to end with an equivalent of $100,000 USD total for the land. 

My dad would choose witch option to go with and then the contract is made. 

We are wondering whether one option is better than the other, for example, if the initial larger sum of money from option 1 can be used to make  ""make money"" even though it is less than half of the total he would get from option 2. 

And if one option is better than the other, is there a way to tell at which point the return is better. For example is option 1 better only after a 10 year period.",1

My income is about 3000/mo after taxes. I have some supplemental income of about 600/mo but that is not 100% stable. Mortgage is just over 1200. Bills and debt come to about 2000. 

I estimate I can walk away from this house with about 70k which will definitely pay off my debt but housing prices around me are ridiculous for my income. Rent is also pretty ridiculous unless I want to live in a studio apartment in the ghetto. Which I don’t. If I did that I would lose at least 300/mo of my income since that is coming from the room I am renting out.  If I move into another 3 bedroom there is a good chance the roommate would move with me. I figure with the sale of this house and after paying off debts I can afford another house for about 150k but after a few hours of searching on Zillow and such it would make my commute at least an hour to an hour and a half. 

As I feared when I first purchased my current home I’ve been pretty much priced out of the market on my salary.

Apologies if this violates any rules mods, but I wasn’t sure where else to post this.

I’m a recent college grad making a little under $40,000 a year. I currently live at homes with my parents, but rent is ridiculously expensive around here (roughly $1600 a month for a 500 sq ft apartment). I’m looking to move out on my own, but that means I have to find something a lot cheaper. 

I was browsing apartments.com, and found a single unit for $800 a month. Now that is absolutely dirt cheap, but I had to email the owner anyways just to double check if it was legit or not.

Today he emailed me back, saying that he’s gotten a job overseas and is trying to rent out the place because he’s staying there for several years. Apparently he owns it outright, and claims that he’s renting below market value because he wants to find a responsible tenant. That seems a little backwards to me, because I imagine lower rent would attract the opposite crowd but whatever.

The real red flags come from this: The rent of 800$/month is for the whole apartment and includes all the
utilities: heat, water, electricity, parking, laundry in-suite, washer
and dryer also included, cable and internet. He also claims that if any repairs need to be done, that he would pay for that all himself.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

**Age / Industry / Location**

* (Me) 31 / Real Estate / San Francisco
* (Wife) 29 / Corporate Level Retail / San Francisco

**General goals**

My goal is to semi-retire/fully retire by the age of 45. Similiar to probably most people on here, the freedom to pick up a couple hobbies or start a business while not having to worry about the rat race.

**Target FIRE Age / Amount / Withdrawal Rate / Location**

* 45-50 / I think I need the equivalent of roughly $200K in today's dollars. Roughly $5.0mm. 4% WR would yield $200k per year in retirement / likely California but would be open to moving to other locations in the US when we partially retire.

**Educational background and plans**

* We both have Undergraduate degree with no plans for MBA.

**Career situation and plans**

* We are both in good career paths at the moment with good potential for higher income jumps. We have no plans to switch careers or change jobs at the moment.

**Current and future income breakdown, including one-time events**

* I make $175,000 with bonus up to 20% (usually always the max 20%)
* Wife makes $170,000 with bonus up to 20% (usually always the max 20%)
* We fully expect to break $200K base each in the next year or two.

**Budget breakdown**

* **401K:** We max our traditional 401Ks. I get a 6% match and wife gets 4%. We are both matched and vested at each bi-weekly pay check. This is currently $55,300 annually.
* **IRA:** We max our IRAs. We use the back door Roth. $12,000 annually.
* **HSA:** We max our HSA. Companies do not provide any match here. $7,000 annually.
* **Post-tax savings:** We have not started to track religiously, but we usually end up putting away an extra $3,000 a month away in post tax savings. $36,000 annually.
* **Bonus:** The 20% annual bonuses will all go directly to post tax savings. This is likely an extra $40,000 or so a year after tax.
* **Mortgage (Ins, Tax, HOA, etc):** $5200 a month
* **Other:** I have not adjusted my withholding to reflect home interest deductions. I expect whatever this ends up saving us extra per year will be thrown into our savings.
* **All else:** ??? (Everything outside of the above everything else goes to fun, vacation, going out, eating out, life insurance, etc)

**Asset breakdown, including home, cars, etc.**

* We just bought a condo in San Francisco city. We wiped out most of our cash by putting 20% down and we are now drastically trying to rebuild our funds.
* **Real Estate:** \~$960,000 asset value (we live in)
* **Emergency Fund:** $30K (Invested in a Money Market. Building this to$50K then throw into post tax brokerage)
* **IRAs:** $80,000 in IRA (Schwab Target Date Index Funds)
* **Checking:** $8K
* **401K:** $135K (Vanguard Target date Index Funds)

No Cars.

**Debt breakdown**

* $38,000 in wife's student loan at 2% fixed. We have not thrown money at this yet because the rate was so low... though I am open to hearing what FI's position is on this.
* $800,000 mortgage balance

**Health concerns**

* None.

**Family: current situation / future plans / special needs / elderly parents**

* In the future, we will likely need to take care of my wife's mom. This will likely consist of buying a \~$150k home for her and maybe some other bills. This is 10-20 years in the future.
* We would like to have 2 or 3 kids in the next 5 or so years.

**Questions?**

So my main questions are:

1. General feedback on current status.
2. Advice on savings strategy. We have only been making the above incomes for about a year. We also paid off a number of debts previously. We finally feel in a position to start doing something meaningful with our savings. Curious to see some feedback and whether we need to really start turning things up and start following a strict budget or what.

I like Tesla but is risky in my opinion. ROKU is another great pick IMO, but lately has  been wild up and down. 

Microsoft is great too. 

Any suggestions on some nice long term stock options?",1

I am currently looking into cars to make my first car purchase. I have settled on a used car that, with my built up $6,000 savings, can purchase outright. However, I would like to also begin my journey into building credit and purchase the vehicle with a credit card, and then immediately pay it off so that I start my credit history with a large sum paid off on time.

t3_bycs9e,Can my parents retire?,"Hi /r/personalfinance 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom is looking to retire in the next year but her financial knowledge is somewhat lacking. The main reason she wants to retire is that her work is kind of hinting that she'll be pushed out of her job in the next year because they want someone much younger. At her current age (53) it'd be pretty hard for her to find another similar job, especially because she can't speak English very well.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a few issues however that I was wondering if I could get more clarification for. First is that she has literally no 401k or IRA, instead she has about 65k in savings/liquid investments which tbh isn't a lot. Next year she will also be 55 so she can't claim social security or medicare for quite a few years. However in exchange for retiring early her work has promised her a severance payment of around 25k and an extra 2k to her yearly pension. Her pension amount should be around 70k annually with the extra 2k which equates to about 40% of her most recent annual salary. She lives alone in a house that's paid off and only has a car debt that's around 9k. She grew up very poor so as a result she's pretty frugal with her living arrangements and isn't suspect to lifestyle creep or overspending (she literally eats eggs, veggies and rice everyday). 

&amp;#x200B;

My main question is, is not having a 401k or retirement account okay if she has that annual pension of 70k? She lives in a pretty high COL area (SoCal) but probably only spends around half of that a year. She plans on purchasing health insurance until she qualifies for medicare. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second question is, is her pension safe? My main worry is that her pension will stop paying out if the account runs out of money or goes bankrupt because in that case she'd be pretty screwed. Her pension is from the State of California which I hope is safe but you never know. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Licensed Massage Therapist of 5+ years and have had my share of ups and downs.  When I initial started Massage things went decently, pay was consistent and via car payments and some light credit card use my credit actually got pretty respectable.  A few years ago I ended up with a DUI and did not have the money to handle the situation (I certainly learned my lesson pretty quickly).  I had to use my credit cards to pay for everything and now I am 8,800 in debt to my creditors. Additionally I have back-taxes I owe the IRS and heavily unpaid student loans.   Ya.... I know I'm fucked and I probably sound like a financial dunce, I just need help.

I lost my private contractor job in October and was out of work about 5 months where my mother was able to assist me.  I am working again at new jobs with super high earning potential, Yet I haven't gotten a paycheck in 3 weeks because things are slow and I am not getting clients.  I've never missed a payment but this is the first week ever where might actually happen.  My interest rate is roughly 24% and it's really killing me, so I reluctantly inquired about national Debt Relief and wonder if it may be right for me.  

I care about my credit so I'm obviously hesitant about letting my credit drop due to this program.  Currently my monthly CC payments run me about 275 bucks and about 170 of that seem to be interest.  What was offered to me was a 2.5 year plan @ 228/month (saving me roughly 50 bucks a month) and saving me roughly 2000 by the end.  I understand the repercussions of defaulting on my cards,  and that I could be sued, However was assured that my debt is not large enough for that to be a valuable option for my creditors.   Right now I'm drowning in credit debt because of one dumb night 2 years ago and I'm desperate for help. I'm trying to work and make more money but right now it's just not coming my way.  At the moment if I don't take this plan I will have to skip my payments this month anyway because I have 15 dollars to my name.  I'm looking for a third job outside of massage therapy because I'm dying without a properly consistent paycheck.

What should I do? Is this plan reasonable based on what I owe?  Is there a better solution?",1

t3_by7620,Tax and miscellaneous questions with scholarships,"Hi everyone, I'm a graduating high school senior and have a couple of questions regarding scholarship money.

I'm going to be taking a gap year before I begin university, and I'll be receiving around $4000 this tax year from a fellowship for my gap year with which I'll sustain myself throughout the year, and I'll receive another $4000 during the next tax year.

I also received a general $1000 scholarship and have $1000 saved from working during the year, which I don't plan on spending. Since I'm assuming the $4000 I'll receive will be considered taxable income, is it worth going ahead and investing the $1000 I have from the separate scholarship or just holding onto it for a year and using it for paying tuition next year in order to not have it be taxed. Regardless, what would be my best bet for holding on to the $1000 from work as well-- could I expect any meaningful gains from investing it for a year or should I just put it in a savings account?

On a totally separate note, as far as I know scholarships are not taxable so long as they're spent on tuition or books or things directly related to school (i.e. not room and board). Once I start uni I'll be receiving a $10,000/year scholarship and my parents plan on paying a similar amount for whatever I need, so would my best bet be to solely use the scholarship money on tuition and have my parents pay for my room so that I don't have to pay any taxes on the money?

Sorry if my writing is a bit confusing, it's a reflection of how confusing all of this is to me :P

Thank you!

EDIT: One last question, is there any special process I'll need to keep in mind to file taxes while I'm on my gap year as I'll be outside of the country the entire time? Also, for 8 months outside of the country I'll be receiving ~$70/week as a volunteer stipend; is this something I will also need to report?",1

t3_bybx69,Scared putting cash savings into investments,"I’m 27 living in NYC and my current net worth is sitting at about $125k. The bulk of that is in cash savings. Here’s how it breaks down:

$74k high yield savings (2%)    
$33k traditional IRA    
$20k brokerage (mostly ETFs)    
$4k HSA    
$5k checking (maintained as a buffer)    
$10k student loans remaining    

Base salary is $160k, $15k bonus, and have some side income (consulting) that gets me close to $200k income each year. Saving about 25% of my income which I think is pretty good considering how expensive Manhattan is. I understand making that amount in another city would warrant a much higher savings rate (if you don’t let income creep into your lifestyle choices). 

I don’t really have any immediate plans for the cash but I’m fearful of putting it in investment vehicles. I definitely want to buy a home in the next 3-8 years once I move out of NYC and settle in a lower cost of living area.

My current plan is to get to $100k in cash savings by the end of the year and next year start maxing out a 401k and put the remaining into my brokerage account. So I’m stuck in a situation where I both fear putting that cash into investments but also fear that I’m missing out on considerable growth by keeping it in cash.

t3_by9j8f,"I have very little money left over after my bills, what should I be doing to reduce my debt with the money I have left over?","To start off with I have made a lot of poor financial choices, some out of ignorance, some because I let income creep take over blah blah blah. All my choices have led me to where I am now and I’m trying to sort everything out. 

To start off with here is my incoming and outgoing money 

Monthly Bills

Rent - 1st $750 + Utilities (EST $850 total)

Gym - 1st $28 ($8 if I go 12 times a month, my health insurance will pay $20 of the $28)

Credit card - 1st- $21

Spectrum -7th - $58

Credit card-11th -$85

Car - 15th-  $500

Insurance - 19th $200

Electric - 19th -$140

Credit card-20th  - $85

Credit card - 20th - $85

Food $100

Gas $60

Total: $2,270

Income $2500 + 4 bonuses a year between $400-$700 each. 

Savings: $0

These are the things I pay every month, and there are two things I haven’t been paying. My student loans, which are around $300 a month, and my first semester of senior year I was misdiagnosed with depression and going on the meds and everything put me on a roller coaster of emotions or whatever and I ended up dropping my classes before my semester ended so I now owe them $3700 that idk how to pay back. 

You may notice in my budget I don’t have a cell phone budgeted, I’ve switched to mint mobiles cheapest plan and now pay around $180 a year in one lump sum. 

My income also is based on the minimum I expect the make, I will make anywhere from $1250 per pay period to $1350 with overtime. 

So as you can see I’m carrying a lot of debt that I’m actively paying, and a lot that I don’t even know how to touch. 

Second job: I’ve been actively looking for a second job but due to my full time job I haven’t been able to find on with hours that work, so I’ve been just trying to get as much OT at my main job as possible. 

My car: Yes, I know the payment is super high, I’ve been looking to private sell my car to get myself into something cheaper but I still need to pay off $3k ish before I can sell it for what I owe. 

My credit cards: I owe about $9k and I’m trying to figure out how to pay them off faster

My student loans/what I owe my college: Idk how to pay them honestly and I keep falling farther behind

My rent: In October I’m moving in with roommates, my rent will drop below $600 a month with utilities, electric and internet. 

So what should I be doing? I have a little bit of extra money every month with Ot, should I be putting it into whatever I can pay forward my student loans? 
Should I try paying off some of my credit cards? I’m leaning towards this so that once I sell my car I can actually get approved for a loan for a different one. Or work on paying extra into my car every month?

I’m trying to be responsible but all my past irresponsible mistakes have caught up to me and idk what to do. 

Final note I can think of, my phone is broken so I cannot make phone calls so I’m not sure how to contact people to see if I can reduce my bills, I wanted to see if I could reduce my monthly student loan payment to something manageable but I can’t call them until I figure out a different phone.",1

I have been in mainland Europe for 3 weeks now.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to my previous performance issue, I was put under close watch (weekly informal review) and every one in the 3 weeks was positive and on Tuesday I asked my line manager for feedback and she said I was quite good so far. She has never managed a graduate before so she said she never had a bench mark to compare to. However, on Friday I was told that I was not performing well, was behind the learning curve and I am not upto the standards they expect from the trainees of their own country. The bloke went as far as saying I was not smart enough, which is kinda insulting and not constructive feedback (for the record I went to a top 5 UK Uni and graduated in Top 10%). I sent him a linkedin request a while ago and he never accepted me but said at the meeting my LinkedIn was too much text and reflected my personality which again is none of his business.

&amp;#x200B;

At the very least, I think everybody should take the time to confirm that they are contributing at least enough to get any company match and to confirm that they have an asset allocation that is appropriate for their age and risk tolerance. If they don’t want to think about it anymore after that, then they can put everything into a lifecycle fund. But how do you convince people to at least take these first few steps?

Edit: I hear what everybody’s saying about not giving unsolicited advice. So how about another approach. I’ll show people how to update their beneficiary in their accounts. Especially for people who are married and/or have children, I’m sure it’s important to them that their money go to their family.

One thing that concerns me - I've read that the times you're driving for Uber/Lyft and don't have passengers is not covered by either your personal insurance or by these companies and that I'd have to pay for additional coverage.

To further complicate the matter, I understand I couldn't leverage the miles that I'm on Uber/Lyft that are part of my normal ride home as mileage expense.

With all this, Are there any income or tax advantages to driving that I could leverage based on my current situation or should I just forget it and sell my car?

t3_byai2b,IRA to 401k reverse roll-over?,"I was laid off last August and rolled my 401k to my Vanguard IRA as the old fund choices weren't great.  

&amp;nbsp;


I've since started started a new job with a higher salary and wonder if I made an impatient decision.    

&amp;nbsp;


My annual salary is 115k + 15% bonus opportunity.  With maxing my 401k, standard deduction for single, and max HSA, I'm guessing this will put me at ~99k magi.   I don't think the 122k phase out for roth is likely to be a problem in the near future, but won't rule out all possibility.   

&amp;nbsp;


My rolled over funds are in VTIVX at .15% ER.  My new provider is Prudential with a company specific 2045 fund.  The ER is .05% and shows the following performance

|Prior Month|-4.66%|

|Prior Quarter|11.56%|

|Year to Date|12.71%|

|1 Year|-0.75%|

|3 Year|8.73%|

|5 Year|5.64%|

|10 Year|10.60%| 


&amp;nbsp;


Overall it looks like a solid performer with a lower ER than in my IRA.  I'm thinking about doing a reverse roll-over from the IRA back to the 401k.  I'll save a little on expense, get good performance, and be able to do a backdoor roth if I'm fortunate enough to have the need down the road.    

&amp;nbsp;


Is there any reason I shouldn't be going ahead with this, assuming Prudential supports it?  I assume the tax paperwork looks just like it did for this year where you show a distribution but its marked as a rollover. It looks like the one-per-year rollover rule isn't applicable to/from 401k's so I can do this whenever and don't need to wait 12 months from the rollover.  

&amp;nbsp;


The only other condition that comes to mind is my new employer was recently acquired, but the new parent organization organization shares the same 401k provider.

t3_by6yg9,Education savings for two children,"I have a 4 year old and 1 year old. Started a 529 (Georgia, Path2college plan) plan for the 4 year old, contributing $2k/year. There's about $11k there now. 

Haven't started anything separate for son #2. 

We plan to send the kids to private school, which at current rates would be $9k/year for k-8 and a bit more for high school. 

The 529 plan and state of GA allows contributions state-tax free up to $8k per year per beneficiary. I can also withdraw up to $10k per year per beneficiary for K-12 education expenses for private schools. 

So, my thinking is that we should open a second account for our second child and begin building a buffer account for each child to pay for k-12 schooling.   If we do well enough in those accounts, they could have $20k+ left in them by the time the boys start college and that's a good head start. Doing this saves the state tax on $8k worth of their tuition every year.  As I see it, this guarantees a ""discount"" on their tuition and in the event one or both opt not to go to college, we can see that coming sooner and stop contributing and exhaust those funds before they're out of high school.

The other option would be to pay for k-12 normally each year and contribute slightly less to their 529s. We would not be able to do a full $8k to their 529s and pay for private school at the same time, so they may not end up with much more money this way and there's the risk that of they opted not to go to college, we have to find other ways to use that 529 money. 

Big picture, we're already saving 10%+ of our net income for retirement across 401ks and Roths. I have a small taxable account as well. I also plan to start Roths for the boys as soon as they have earned income so they can use the money there for some college expenses if they need/want to. House is on pace be paid off when son #1 starts college so we have options to help more with school expenses if we want to. 

Helping them get through school with a reasonable amount of debt is very important to us. I paid the vast majority of my college tuition with loans and graduated with $75k in debt for undergrad.  I knew I was making that choice when I chose my college and what it would take to get out from under that.  I'd like to give my kids more freedom and comfort if they choose the same path.

I'm open to any other thoughts on college savings...thanks!",1

t3_by9x6o,HOA Lien - need some advice,"Hi PF, I'm in a situation and I'm hoping for some advice. I know this is of my own making but would like to hear some objective thoughts.

Background: The HOA of my small subdivision has dues of $200/year, due on Jan 1. I've paid on time for many years, but this year my spouse had some health problems and was on an unpaid medical leave so I let some bills slide. I did make the $200 payment via my bank's bill pay (as I had done for years to the same address and with the same account number) on April 20. I realize this was over 90 days late, but my thought was 'better late than never' and the HOA had not been very stringent about late dues in the past - which is why I prioritized other bills over the HOA dues when our income was tight.

This week I got a letter from a law firm that said they represented the HOA as a debt collector. There was a list of fees including lawyer's fees, title search, and interest that added up to $958. And there was a notarized ""Claim of Lien"" against my home.

I checked my account history on the bank website and noticed a deposit of $200 on April 25. When I inquired at the bank they said it was from the HOA, who rejected my April 20 bill payment as ""no matching account.""

I know I've made a few mistakes but what can I do now? I kind of feel like I made a provable good faith attempt to pay my dues, although it was late, prior to the legal actions against me. I also don't really have a disposable $958 and would need to pull from our small emergency savings. Should I try to fight this in any way, or is that foolish and I should just pay it and be done?

Any advice appreciated.",1

t3_by9wb5,What’s actually a reasonable amount to spend on an engagement ring?,"Hi everyone, long time lurker and have a question I’d love some insight on.  I’ll keep the background relatively quick and vague.  

I am in my early 30s and dating a girl now who’s the same age.  Incredible match, been dating a year, absolutely in love, things couldn’t be much better.  I never have found myself thinking about proposing before in my three decades of life, but the time has come.  

With that in mind, I’ve had the discussion with friends and family on what’s acceptable to spend on an engagement ring.  As you’d expect the answers always vary.  So I figured let’s see what strangers on the internet may think.  My girlfriend is so sweet and really doesn’t care about money or necessarily the size of her ring.  She also comes from humble beginnings and is an Aussie (humble culture IMO), shout out to fellow Aussies!  I am not one.

My financial situation is this.  I make good money, I am fortunate enough to be able to bring a hefty income every year.  However, I am in sales, so most of that income is commission based and is completely variable.  But with commissions I bring in anywhere from 4-500k every year.  Early on in life I was terrible with credit cards, loans and had a lot of debt, close to 6 figures.  While I wiped all of that away thankfully, I am trying much harder to be more money conscious as I get older and save.  Part of the reason why I love this sub, a lot of familiar circumstances as me.  I still don’t have as much saved as I’d like, but it’s getting better every month. 

What is a reasonable amount of money to spend on a ring, where one I don’t insult her by going too little and two, I don’t over indulge by spending too much?  

Someone told me the 3 month salary rule and I am thinking no way would I spend close to 6 figures on an engagement ring.  

I am sure people will call me a liar on my income, or that I’m obnoxious for being 6 figures in debt, but let’s all see pass these issues and just believe I am truly looking for non biased insight here, and my post is truthful.  Thank you in advance!",1

t3_by3vtu,Father passed. Owes IRS quite a bit. Has house with about 13% equity stake. Question about how the home might be transferable to heirs.,"Edit: Thank you all for the responses. This helped set us down the path with some knowledge and confidence.

Looking for some insight into how this could play out.

* Father passed (divorced from mom).
* No will of any kind.
* Owes ~$30k to IRS and say $13k to Credit Cards.
* Major assets include about a 13% equity stake in his home(value $90k), a paid off truck (value $25k), and about $6k in bank. He also had a sizable pension paying close to $5k/mo. but I don't believe any of that is inheritable. (Wouldn't that be nice.)

So I have a couple interests here. The route my siblings as I are taking is basically to let the Mortgage Co. or IRS (whomever) initiate probate before we step in to get Powers(attorney etc). This was to save on legal fees since his estate was negative and we expected to have everything go to cover his debt. Then we just liquidate and sign as necessary until everything is settled.

Considering his debt, I'm unsure if it's even possible to do either of the following

* 1) acquire or take-over-for his house? How does the IRS get the equity stake from the home? Does the bank pay the IRS the value of the equity and take full ownership? 
* 2) acquire his paid off truck? I assume the only option here would be to buy it off the estate for value? Who would we pay, the IRS or the Credit Co.?

In the case of the home, I don't even live in the state it's in, but I can't help but wonder if there is an opportunity here to turn something good out of this situation. I'm mostly interested in possibly keeping the home as a rental property. Hoping you guys might be able to shed some light on how that might be possible and at what cost?

In the case of the truck, it's just such a nice truck. 2016 Dodge Ram. Very clean with most of the bonus addons. We hate to see it disappear. So basically the same question. What would be possible in terms of acquiring the truck from the estate? It would be a very good upgrade for at least 1 of us children and is a usable asset that would likely be kept for years to come.

Thus far, the only light in this tunnel has been the possibility no one will initiate probate within a specified time period and that somehow forfeits the estate to the heirs. I think this has something to do with the fact that he had no Will and resided in the state of Kansas. 

I realize it's unlikely the IRS would pass up on that amount, but I've also heard they're pretty flexible with making arrangements.

Any insight into this situation concerning how to make the best of it would be greatly appreciated. We sat with a lawyer early on in the process but we didn't really know the right questions to ask. Or she wasn't really knowledgeable about how to turn an estate like this in the best possible way. Or it simply wasn't possible. I don't really blame her in any way. I simply just don't know how else to get good answers about how out-of-luck we are or how we can make the best of this.

I will be responding to any questions as much as it seems wise and helps. I feel like anything good is unlikely, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",1

Regions Bank does not allow ACH transfers for my account, and Schwab does not use Zelle. Wire transfers have a limit on how much you can send and are costly. Regions Customer Service said I should use PayPal to do the transfer if I don't want to use wire transfers, but PayPal now requires you to sign up for a PayPal Cash account which is just something I probably wouldn't even use. I just want to transfer money from one bank to the other, and I feel this really shouldn't be so complicated so maybe I'm missing something.

I heard ""pushing"" money is better than ""pulling"" money and Regions never mentioned anything about me simply ""pulling"" money from Regions so I don't know how successful that would be. My next option was to withdraw money from a Regions ATM to the max limit per day and just go to whatever ATM accepts Schwab. I know Schwab reimburses all ATM fees, but if my current balance is $0, will it take that temporary ATM fee out of my deposit or will it draw it from my initial $0 balance and put me under temporarily?

I have spoken to bupa consultants who have said that I would be able to get a continuation policy which would have no further underwriting, meaning that I would still be able to have my operation when the time arises. However, the policy would then become a personal policy and so I’m worried that the premiums will rise significantly?

t3_by9747,$0 balance on a Perkins student loan showing open on my TransUnion credit report. Is this a problem?,"I recently ran a TransUnion credit report that showed I had 2 open accounts, which was odd since I only knew of 1 (my credit card). Turns out the second ""open"" account was a Perkins student loan with a $0 balance. I'm positive that I paid it in full over a year ago, so I know I'm not on the hook for anything.

Is this something negatively impacting my credit that I should try to get removed from my report? I have many other closed federal student loans (including other Perkins), so I'm not sure why this one in particular is hanging on.

If so, who should I start with? TransUnion? My loan servicer? My college?

I appreciate any advice!",1
t3_bybhw3,Why credit score boosted 27pts suddenly?,"Just checked my credit today, it’s weird that my credit score goes up 27pts.
TransUnion 766 (always around 750-760)
Equifax 790 (suddenly boosted 27pts)

I always paid my bills on time, always paid it completely off or leave an unpaid amount around $20-$50 for another billing cycle. I only been charged for interest about 2-3 times in last 5 yrs ever since I owned credit cards, the limited experiences I have were only charged 1-3 dollars, which is nothing. (Around 20%apr for the less $100 debt. But still I don’t understand how the billing cycle work. Why 99% of time do not charge? )

Anyway, I have nothing changed  recently, why my credit goes up?",1
t3_by93mh,Pay down student loan debt or start investing/open brokerage,"After plans fell through for a relocation that I was saving up for, I have approximately five grand that I can use smart (the rest of the savings will be put into a higher yield savings account for emergency use). 

I’ve been reading some on here and also financial books (eg Dave Ramsey and Rich Dad Poor Dad) and thinking that I need to make my money work harder for me than just sitting in your traditional banks savings account. 

Also looking at refinancing the bulk of my (unfortunately high) student loan debt to a lower interest rate. Here are the options I’m considering:

1) refinancing at a fixed rate with higher amount to pay off loans in an aggressive manner (still will take 5+ years) [more Dave Ramsey debt snowball like]

2) refinancing at a lower variable rate with a less aggressive approach and opening a brokerage account and putting more into investments [more Rich Dad, Poor Dad like] 

3) man the f* up and see a fiduciary like a grown ass adult (should prolly do this anyway) 

Any advise on these options would be great. Thanks for all the input.

Income: $45,000/yr
Interest rate on debt:
- largest loan rate: 6.74%
- next largest rate: 6.24%

t3_by93h5,First time getting a car from a dealership!,"Hello financial redditors! So I'm in the market for a used car and so far, I've got my eyes on the 2018 Camry SE.

So one of my questions is when I get the car loan, I should get it for $18000 right (Since the $2k will go to the dealership)?

t3_by8u97,"What constitutes as ""savings"" when using rule of thumb?","This has always frustrated me, and financial advisers seem to be inconsistent on the definition as well.

We're very early 30's and working hard to augment our income more than anything, rather than spending an inordinate amount of time making sure we're *right on track* for retirement; which is why I want to just use a rule of thumb for now so we can focus our attention on expanding our education, skills, etc. and we want our savings to be *in the ballpark*.

&amp;#x200B;

People will say ""save at least 10%"" or 15%, or something. But this is a hugely ambiguous figure to me.

Does this include employer matches on 401k?

Does this include HSA account savings if you have no expensive chronic health issues today? What about employer HSA matching?

On what basis are you comparing to yield the 15% of X; what is X? Net pay? Gross pay? Adjusted gross income? 

What about 529 plans? Is that considered ""savings?"" or since that money is earmarked for my daughter's education, probably not right? Obviously that's not retirement money... but is that ""savings"" if you know it'll be spent?

&amp;#x200B;

Our monthly expenses vary widely. There's no easy way for us to ""budget"" monthly. We just live below our means. We have no debt other than mortgage and 2 fairly new vehicles.

What I'm wanting to do is setup to healthily/heavily save but whatever money is left in our checking accounts my wife (mostly) can go wild with. That works better for us, so our time can be focused on comfort and figuring out how to gain value and skills in our careers.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a very basic flow chart of how we're currently living. Very LCOL area.

[https://imgur.com/a/zwYxpFK](https://imgur.com/a/zwYxpFK)

Regarding the large ""other"" category, this is anything from home repairs, charitable donations, pets, new washer/dryer, vacation, shopping, etc. etc. We pull from this and often drop large sums into VTSAX, our daughters 529 plan, etc typically when we get our bonus or tax return. But I didn't count that as savings here because it just depends.",1

t3_by5cwf,Is anyone familiar with Flex 40 salary?,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this. I'm mostly just looking for other experiences, comments, and opinions on my own experience. 

I am currently being paid on a 'salary' plan called Flex 40. Essentially what it means is that I'm guaranteed to be paid for 40 hours a week, even if I work less. The trade-off is that I only get paid half my hourly rate for overtime. 

Because I am expected to work less than 40 hours a week for 6 - 8 months of the year, and expected to work significantly more than 40 hours a week for 4 - 6 months out of the year, it 'balances out'. My hourly rate for 40 hours/wk is much lower than it should be to make up for the fact that, on most weeks, I work less than 40 hours. I get paid half my hourly rate for overtime, instead of the nothing that salary gets, but is half of a rate that is already lower than what it should be. 

Does anyone have any particularly strong feelings about Flex 40 or other payment systems like this? Good or bad experiences? I don't have a lot of perspective on this kind of thing and am hoping to hear from people who do.",1
t3_by8jp9,Debt Collection Issue,"Hi, 

I currently have a car debt that's been apparently transferred over to National Recovery Center for resolution now.

In the letter it also states that failure to do so and applicable to law it could negatively impact my credit history and could include placing my account with an outside collection agency.   
I've lurked around this subreddit  before for advice on other things and I remember reading somewhere that it was better to just ignore them because once they transfer it back and forth they don't even know who the account belongs to, but is that the best option for me right now?

Knowing this information, how can I negotiate for more money when the time comes in about 2 weeks?

t3_by4out,What can I realistically afford in the Bay Area?,"Fast stats:

* Combined income $350k, but at least $50k comes from RSUs. I don't really like treating RSUs like typical income because they vest at limited times, so I've been using $300k as an approximation.
* Savings: $400k (basically prepared to empty out our savings minus emergency funds to throw at a home)
* Debt: No debt

I'd like to stay in South Bay / Peninsula (Sunnyvale, Mountain View, West San Jose, Cupertino, Santa Clara) given that's where the jobs are. East Bay is an option for affordability but I really don't want the quality of life involved with a 1+ hour commute sitting through only 15 miles of traffic.

If I do the quick 1/3 income stats, I really have a hard time seeing how $100k / year ($8.3k) going to a home is realistically possible. I'm thinking of more topping out around $6k in monthly costs  which is around $1 million in mortgage. Basically it means I top out around $1.4 million in home costs which means the nicer areas are a bit of a stretch.

Furthermore I shudder to think of what would happen if we have kids and / or switch jobs. Tech jobs aren't exactly the most friendly for work/life balance and so I feel pressure to maintain our current trajectory or else be totally screwed.",1
t3_by8f6i,Am I missing something by only using a credit card sparingly?,"I have one credit card and only use it for bigger expenses. For most everything else I use a debit card. My friends think I'm kind of an idiot for not cashing in on the rewards that credit cards offer, and most of them carry multiple CCs (cash back, travel, etc.). Perhaps they are right to reap those rewards, I did not go to business school and finance is not a strong suit of mine. But my reasoning to primarily use a debit card is because I feel like it makes me more conscious of my spending. Aside from occasionally ""treating"" myself, it's always seemed better to forego using rewards to buy things I didn't really need in the first place. Those savings seems more substantial than the benefits credit cards have to offer. Am I wrong?

This isn't meant to be a self-congratulatory post, it honestly feels like I'm getting whooshed. I get comments somewhat regularly when out with friends like ""oh, you use a debit card?"". And the way that credit cards are so heavily promoted makes it feel like I'm really missing something.

Btw I'm 30 and single.

t3_by869e,Dad had large stroke and still jointly owns home and shares a pension with ex-wife. Help!,"I’ll try to keep this brief. My dad recently had a pretty large stroke that has left him with expressive aphasia (meaning he can understand most things but cannot get his own words out).

My parents divorced last year and left their home as a joint asset. My mom lives in the home and my dad moved into an apartment.

Neither of them have a will or a plan as to how this asset gets divided up should one of them die.

I’m my dad’s main caregiver and advocate in all of this. He could definitely use extra money as we move him through rehab and into assisted living. I’m wondering if there is some magical way that my mom could stay in the home and my dad could still utilize his half of the home’s value? Is this possible?

Beyond that, my dad has a pretty decent pension that he lives off of month-to-month. When he had set this up almost 15 years ago he made sure that after he died a portion of that pension would go to my mom. This still seems to be in place after the divorce. Is it possible to restructure the pension so he gets more now without that money going to my mom? The idea was that my dad, who has always been an ‘older dad’, retired when I was pretty young. This was put in place to benefit my mom and my siblings if something happened to my dad when we were still young.

I need to make appointments with a financial advisor with my mom, as well as an elder law attorney. Any other recommended professionals I should see?

Please feel free to answer whatever you can - I’d really appreciate it!

Edit: my dad had not named anyone as a power of attorney and as far as I know does not have a living will in place. We’ve been discussing me moving forward with becoming power of attorney as we wait to see how he recovers.",1
