Sooner or later, that debt is paid.”- Valery Legasov Soviet Chemist and Chief of the commission investigating the Chernobyl disaster","Isn’t that what debt is?

t3_bzgsp7,Baby Step 2 - Second Student Loan Paid Off,"Another day, another dollar, another debt paid off. While I’ve got a long way to go, and no funds to spare on a steak dinner at a restaurant, I decided to celebrate by checking in here.

The item I took care of today was a 2,608.00 student loan. I should note that I defaulted on it several years ago and it was sitting on my credit report. However, this was the next item on my snowball list. 

I called up the lender and got transferred to a different department. They confirmed the amount outstanding and asked if I’d like to setup a payment plan. Being able to respond with “no, I’d like to pay off the balance in full” felt awesome. 

I’ve been feeling in a bit of a rut with the routine of living on a budget. However, in that moment, I felt some real happiness and more importantly, in control. The peanut butter and honey sandwiches and house coffee at work have paid off, literally. 

An optimistic estimate on paying off everything is about 3 years. While I’ve got a ways to go, I’m going to stay the course. 

The next item is yet another student loan at a little over $3,200. I look forward to celebrating paying that one off soon.",0
t3_bzovir,Money &amp; dating,"Hi DR subreddit! I’m almost done replenishing BS1 and I can’t wait to get back to BS2. I’m single as in not married but I have a boyfriend. He’s already thinking we will probably head down the marriage road in the future. I can see that happening with him, but I’m scared. I have about $65,000 in BS2 (paying off a phone, car, and student loans). He has even more in BS2 - pretty much all SL’s and close to 6 figures. 

I have mentioned casually that I’m working the Dave plan and that it’s important to me because I’m divorced and I simply refuse to remarry if my partner isn’t on board with it. He has listened, but he has said he plans to finance a brand new car in the next couple years because he gets an employee discount because his grandpa is retired from one of the American auto makers. In his opinion, he can’t turn down the huge discount he will get and he doesn’t know how much longer his grandpa will be around so he can get it. His current car is paid off and is a 2011 and has given him zero problems since he’s had it so in my opinion he needs to keep it and give everything he’s got to his SL’s. He also said he doesn’t want to finance the he’s car until he has at least 50% down ready to go. 

I resent him already for wanting to do this because with his huge student loans, he shouldn’t be financing anything at all, and if we marry, those and the car become my problem. I don’t want to kill myself paying off my own stuff during the next couple years only have to start over with his should we marry and possibly be fighting him on it. But, I also feel like it’s too soon to tell him this could be a dealbreaker because we aren’t at the engagement point yet. He’s wanting to get engaged at around 2 years dating and we are about 9 months in right now but have known each other as friends for nearly 20 years. I want to see him trying to pay down bills independently but I don’t feel like I have the right to pressure him about it just yet. But I’m really worried and I’m up at 4:30 AM thinking about this so clearly it matters to me. Everything else about him is everything I’ve ever looked for in a long term partner. 

This is a very touchy subject so how can I navigate this and make sure I don’t get stuck in a marriage where debt is going to be a pet? He already borrowed and read TMMO from me but I obviously don’t think it has sunk in for him. I can see myself resenting him big time if he goes through with buying the car even if we are not yet married. Help!!!",0
t3_bzkg8w,Cutting up credit cards,"My husband and I are on step 2 and I want to cut up our 2 credit cards while we pay them off, but we keep saying “well, what if something happens (greater cost then the $1k emergency fund).  And my husband says “we will cut them up when they’re paid off, in case we need them.” We bring home about $5700 a month (my husband works full time and I work 1 weekend a month with the National Guard), so realistically if we stick to the budget, we don’t even need the cards at all.

t3_bzm41r,BS6’ers out there...how do you keep motivated?,"After 30 months of constant chipping away, I feel like I’m hitting a wall.  Wife and I have $87k left on the mortgage, down from $245k when we started BS6 in December 2016.  Target date for payoff is about 12 more months...but child expenses are an x-factor that has slowed the roll.  It sure as hell would be easier to just be “normal” and ease off the gas, but we’ve been successfully cranking away at this thing that I don’t want to slow the momentum.  Honestly, I haven’t discussed this with the wife because she’s still motivated, and I don’t want to impact her motivation because she may agree to slow it down if I even suggest it.  And deep down I don’t want to slow anything down because the finish line is in sight.  A July 2020 payoff is a real possibility, and a likelihood so long as we keep it up.  But I’m feeling gassed.  We are putting off a car upgrade, some upgrades around the house, and overall relaxed spending because we are close.  It’s not like I want to go buy frivolous crap either.  But damn.  This is hard.  What words of wisdom can you fellow BS6’ers share to keep up the motivation for a BS6’er who is feeling gassed?   Your tips on how you stay motivated on this long-haul final part of the journey would be greatly appreciated.",0
t3_bzqd6x,HSA in Baby Step #2,"About a week a half ago DR received a question about contributing to an HSA while in BS2.  I thought he gave a bad answer, or at least not a complete one, so that’s what I want to discuss here.  

I think DR was saying that a person shouldn’t contribute to an HSA to save for possible health expenses.  An example of this is putting in $100 per month in case the kids get sick, or in case there’s a accident.  It’s using the HSA to safeguard against future expenses that I think DR is advising against.

But there are many reasons why a person should contribute to an HSA during BS2.  From my own life: my son is going to speech therapy every week at a $45 copay a meet.  That’s $180 a month that we can be fairly certain we’re going pay.  So my HSA must have at least $180 in it every month.  We also have medical bills coming in every month, since we’re not able to pay the full amounts every month.  So that’s an extra amount of money in the HSA that we need above the $180.  Also, my wife is pregnant right now.  And yes we have hit pause on our BS2.  Now, we haven’t been contributing money to the HSA for the upcoming birth (due date is early Jan 2020), but come 2020, when the hospital bills start coming in, we’re probably going to max out, or close to it, our HSA to pay for the birth expenses.

I got the feeling that if I also called with the same question, that DR would have given me the same answer as the other person, and that would have been an answer given out of ignorance; ignorance of my/your personal situations in life.",0

t3_bzbh1t,Looking for a new job: keep paying off debt or build up emergency fund?,"My husband and I are in baby step to and we’ve paid off $44,000 in the past 14 months. We still have $16,000 left to go. At my job, there has been new leadership brought in to help accelerate growth but in the past 3 months, there has been 2 series of layoffs. Whilst I may have survived the layoffs and they say there are no more, I’m still not 100% trusting and am not a fan of what the company culture has become.

Other facts; in the breadwinner. I have a 1 year old.

Edit:
Thanks everyone! I came into work and found out they put my boss and a couple others on 60 day probation and are actively looking for their replacements. With that, I’m going to buff up my emergency fund by $2.5k to help float us 2 months if something happens and then keep chugging along on on debt plan.

t3_bz5gxy,"""Taking out loans is the smartest thing an American can do."" - My Friend","Hey guys - Ramsey fan and practitioner. Long story short - I told my friend that I pay cash for things and never borrow money. I said that loans are the worst idea ever. He was blown away, and began talk about how loans are absolutely genius. He provided this example: if you have $10k and would like to purchase a car that is $20k, borrow the $20k to buy the car (at say, 4% interest) and then invest your liquid $10k in something that returns more than 4% interest (i.e., mutual funds). The idea here is that your money is growing and ultimately canceling out the 4% interest on the vehicle loan. What would Dave say about this? What do you think about this? I wasn't sure how to approach his argument.",0

While i'm lucky and things feel stable only 2 months ago we had a big layoff so until I get a bit more saved up I want to hold off on draining BS3 for BS2. What i'm wondering is by xmas i'll basically be at a place of a 12 month BS3, 15% into 401k and no debt. House wise i'm living with my fiancee and once we're married paying that off early will be a priority but for now it isn't. As such, by my calculations, when i'm debt free i'm going to be in a place where with 15% to 401k and a 6% match from my company (no vesting period) and a maxed roth IRA (which i'd start post car), i'll end up with $1200 a month. having been used to being broke and dumb, wtf am i supposed to do with this money lol?",0
t3_bzemct,Roth TSP federal employee question,"Any retired or current feds out there? I am 37 and face mandatory retirement at 57. Been investing the maximum contribution to the traditional TSP with the agency match and am sitting in 280k. For those unfamiliar the TSP thrift savings plan is similar to the 401k but it's for government employees.  I just discovered Dave Ramsey and am working on baby step 2 however I am still investing maximum towards retirement. I know this is counter productive to his method but I have some money from the VA that I use to offset. 

I just discovered that the agency offers a Roth TSP and I can contribute 19k annually.  Now my question is is it too late to change my traditional TSP (tax deferred) to the Roth? Having  tax free retirement revenue is very enticing but I want to make sure I'm not too old to change over the majority of my contributions to the Roth vs the regular.

I've searched (mostly YouTube) and most say Roth IRA investments are best done at an early age before 30. That's why I'm wondering if it's worth it to change.",0

t3_bza8gw,How to cancel a CC I never used in the first place and cannot find?,"Hi all, I'm new to Dave Ramsey and to adult life. I just graduated college (engineering) and will start my career next month. I have no debt (went to school on full academic scholarship) and I have a good credit score from responsible CC use (rough 800 credit score). I've never paid fees or interest on them; I treat them like debit and never spend more than what I can immediately pay off. I know Dave teaches to never use CCs, but it's worked out well for me to build credit so I'll probably keep using them in the same way. I currently use 2, but have a third that is a Belk store card that I have never used. Stupid 19 year old me opened it to get a discount on an in-store purchase (I bought my parents a new washer and dryer set so it saved me hundreds) and the sales lady promised me it would automatically close if I didn't use it in 2 years. I knowing full well I would never use it, just let it come in the mail and then tucked it away in my parents filing cabinet while I was away at college. Well 4 years have gone by and according to my credit report I have 3 lines of credit opened, so that CC is still somewhere active. But I can't find it anymore (parents did a huge home clean out) and am wanting to cancel it since I just don't want too many lines of credit open. 

Please don't be too mean, I know it was incredibly stupid to open a line of credit just for a discount on one item one time. But if anyone has some advice for how to close out a credit card without having that card number or info, I'd like to put this thing to bed! Advice is much appreciated.",0

t3_bzbznp,BS2- Career Question,"Hi! I’m 30 yo F in BS2, about 13k left to pay (car, student loans). Have paid off 12k in the last 7 months. I was living in Georgia and working for a start up making 45k plus about 5k in bonuses a year. I had some unfortunate life events happen and decided to move back to N.C. on June 1 (here now!) 

The job I was working with was open enough to let me create a job for myself here, so I wrote a job proposal. I’m in sales for a start up consumer product. They came back to me on May 24 with an offer exactly the job I proposed, but a 3 month Non binding contract, and only 2,500/ month pay, and I lost my benefits. Because it’s a contract, I technically need to “prove to them” that it’s worth having me here. And trust me, they needed the help. So, I’m doing the same job, for way less money, and no benefits. (Also no stock of any sort in the company).  Also I have 7 years experience in this industry. I’m getting a part time bar tending job for now bc 2,500 a month after taxes barely covers my debts and expenses, and I can’t throw anything extra towards debt. 

At the end of 3 months they said they will re-evaluate and potentially make it a full time job. My thing is, I doubt they will pay me back up to my 45k salary, and benefits are not guaranteed. Besides this I love what I’m doing and love the people I work with. Have a Very flexible schedule and great work life balance. Should I stick around for the summer or try and find something different? 

I have another potential job with a different start up that could start in August. Will pay closer to 65k and have full benefits. May start before my contract is up.",0

t3_bynwmp,Officially credit card debt free!,"Just paid $1830 towards our final credit card debt.  Now we can start knocking out our final debt, an auto loan. 

Credit card one $536 PAID

Store card $1,277 PAID

Medical $12,370 PAID

Credit card two $14,532 PAID TODAY

Our total snowball is now going solely towards our auto loan!  Only a few months until we are officially done with BS2.

I know I'm going to get crap for this but BS3 and BS4 are already done too.  One of us wouldn't stop our retirement contributions nor would one of us deplete our savings account down to $1k and that's okay.  We are a team and we still knocked out over $28,000 in 3 months.  BS 5 doesn't apply as we don't have kids and we are planning to not reproduce in the future.  Once we are done with the auto loan in a few months we are going to save cash for a new (to me) truck then we are going to start right into paying off our mortgage.  The ""burn the note"" date is set for Jan of 2027.  Only 8 years to go for complete debt freedom.

t3_byf1aj,I did it reddit!,"Today is a huge day for me. I AM DEBT FREE!

Since my divorce was finalized in February I have managed to pay off all $32,000 in debt AND fully funded my six month emergency fund.

After 12 years of constant spending and debt, I will never go back.

I have known of Dave's teachings since I was a child but never thought money was an issue for me until I became sick and tired of being broke about a year ago. Part of my journey included removing myself from a 12 year toxic relationship with a spender who repeatedly told me ""you have changed."" This was a huge wake up call when I realized that I indeed had changed.
I have grown into a responsible adult with goals for myself and the desire to improve my family tree forever.

My debts were:
Credit Cards - $29k between 12% and 32%
Vehicle Loan - $2500 at 4%
Cell Phone - $500

I worked night and day through my personal drywall and paint company, working between as many as 7 different job sites including some 30 hour shifts. I sold everything I didn't need and began to search for deals on every possible product that my company uses which resulted in several small, but noticeable increases in profit that will keep adding up.

This wouldn't have been possible as quickly as I made it happen without all of your debt free screams. That may have been the second greatest contributor next to the ability to spend more time being present with my children.

t3_bypi02,Needs some credit card pay down advice....please,"I have approximately $8k in credit card debt with approximately $9k in the bank. Recently, overtime was cut at my job so I’m down to 40 hours a week which equates to around $3k a month after taxes, child support, health insurance and 401k. 

Monthly expenses equate to approximately $2100 so it would give me a little bit of room to start saving again. I also sell on eBay averaging $300 a month or so. 

So my question is, so I just pay off all the debt...leave me with around $800 in the bank and then start the rebuild.  I just can stand paying on these credit cards anymore but I really hate living paycheck to paycheck which is what I’d be doing for the next couple of months.

However, if you're always saving for a car that you'll buy down the road- isn't it financially just like having a car payment? If my sinking fund is 200 a month for a replacement vehicle I know that I'll have to purchase in 2 years, I'll still have to contribute to a sinking fund for the next car even after that purchase. I'll always have some type of monthly payment. 

I guess I haven't wrapped my head around the ""cash only for a vehicle so you can save money in the future"" part of the TMM. I feel like the advice for a cash car is simply so you dont over extend and buy a car that is beyond what your budget should be able to handle. Any guidance or words of advice on this would be great.",0
t3_by9ewg,Car advice...,"Trying to decide if I should sell my car or not.

Household income is now $180k. Bonuses and stocks vary but add an additional $10-40k depending.

For most of our adult lives, we’ve made between $45k and $80k. Family of four. I recently went back to work full time after 5 years staying home with children and husband recently got big promotion at work.

Our debts are the remaining balance on my student loans - $56k @ 7.75% private grad school right before the recession. I’m a teacher and the laws at that time mandated a masters degree, but yes this was dumb. We’ve paid about half off in the last two years after I went back to work full time (it was over $100k) We currently are paying about $3k/month snowball to it, and will be putting this years entire bonus and stock to it. Should pay off by December!

Mortgage balance is $296k on a house worth $460k. Not too worried about this as it’s after the debt snowball step.

And of course, the car. I foolishly sold my paid off VW station wagon 2 years ago before Dave - it was worth $4k and needed $8k in repairs in one year with another $4k service coming at me so we got rid of it. Got a brand new Hyundai Santa Fe (before Dave - yes I regret this!) but wound up with super scary life threatening transmission problems (google it) so we got out of it and into my current car - 2018 Audi Q5 bought certified preowned under bluebook. Kind of a knee jerk overreaction after the run in with bad Korean engineering, but here we are. I owe $30k on it. It’s a beautiful car, I love driving it, we all fit in it for now (my son is 99th percentile for height and we have a large breed puppy...) Kinda flashy for me but also it’s kind of fun. But I’ve been thinking of selling it since October. Its like Dave says - if someone handed me $42k (what I paid) would I go out and buy it again? Nope. I’d get a used $10-15k Sienna in cash and put the rest toward my snowball or emergency fund. OR make do with one car (he has a paid off ‘09 VW GTI hatch back that actually has more interior room) for awhile as he works from home in tech and rarely needs to drive anymore. 

Soooo I’m kind of emotionally and intellectually ready to sell, but my husband wants to keep the car. We all like it, it’s way less than half our income, etc etc. 

So, looking to poll popular opinion - would you sell or keep it?

Rough budget info:

Monthly net pay: $9000

Mortgage $2100

Debt snowball $3000

Groceries and dining $480 and $100

Student loan minimum payment $600

Car payment $600

Fuel $100

Utilities $750 (high internet bill we have to have for husbands work)


The rest is budgeted for with zero based budgeting but is boring small things - kid allowance, family fun, pocket money, haircuts, etc. I live in a high cost state.

We are not doing it as gazelle intense as we could, but ARE getting more and more committed each month.

I walked around the store once, took a total of 10 minutes because the store is so small, got everything I needed and the line went quickly because they dont' bag your stuff for you (you do it yourself :D).

Now I’m trying to get used to budgeting for a month because that’s how the app works and I do like the app. 

- Does it make sense to look at my checking account and see what the ending balance was on May 31 and add that as a “May Rollover” category on my June budget? That way I actually use “every dollar” in my checking account this month? 
- I like the idea of having a cushion in case I forgot about something coming up. It’s only me so I don’t have someone to remind me of these things. Do you guys keep a safety cushion in your checking? 
- And I’m assuming I’ll always have a little leftover with fluctuating in utilities, groceries, that kind of thing. Do you guys always carry over the leftovers into next month or just add it to your savings, debt snowball, whathaveyou, at the end of the month and start the new month with $0?",0

I need your input on paying off some debt. I’ve had a challenging few years (got laid off, wife too etc) and had to make some tough decisions. Racked up a bit of high interest debt on top of old student loans. 

Now things have stabilized. We have jobs which allow me to focus in repayment. after a very restrictive budget, I’m able to pay 2k towards loans every month.

t3_bx5pm2,Why does Dave hate responsible Credit Card use?,"**Disclaimer:** This is not intended to sway anyone to make irresponsible financial decisions. It is intended to create civil genuine conversation. 

I understand that Dave has to push what his brand is trying to sell but does he really believe that there is never a good reason to use a credit card? 

&gt;[https://youtu.be/zvs5WsfEjMY?t=95](https://youtu.be/zvs5WsfEjMY?t=95) from this clip he says: ""There is never a time to use a credit card. You can't convince me that there's certain times you should use a credit card.""

Maybe he is just associating all credit card transactions with making minimum payments and therefore being charged interest? 

&amp;#x200B;

I can only think of two reason to not use a credit card:

1. **You don't have the money to pay it off in full**
2. **Using a credit card has a tendency to increase your spending** 

I can think of many reasons to use a credit card (these only apply if you don't meet the 2 reasons above to not have one):

1. **Fraud protection.**
   1. If your card is used for Fraud, they haven't stolen any money from you (yet) they have stolen the banks money and you will have a larger buffer window to resolve the issue without money missing from your account.
2. **Cash back, points, miles or whatever is most valuable to you.** 
   1. If you drive to work, you have to buy gas. Why not have that gas give you 4% back? 
   2. If you shop at a grocery store, why not earn cash back or points to put towards that family vacation you're saving for?

Total Monthly Take-Home after taxes and expenses - $5,796.34

""leftover"" income to throw towards student loans - \~$3,496.34

&amp;#x200B;

With this math, if we spent all expendable income on nothing but our student loans, we should have this paid off in 29 months. Obviously we might have to spend on other things, so I made a goal for 3 years. In 3 years we should be debt-free, do you guys think this is an accurate forecast?

t3_bwz9ov,Embarking on the DR plan,"I've been listening to Dave for a few weeks (possibly a month or so) and managed to pick up a copy of TTMM. Got my wife on board with budgeting and we are jumping into BS2.

Current debt:

Car loan 1: $10,250
Car loan 2: $2,000
CC1: $300
CC2: $950

Current household income: $73k (combined)

Recently graduated from college with a degree in computer science and with some grants as well as my G.I bill I have no student loans. Our plan is to have the total debt of $13,500 in less than 6 months, this way we can move on to BS3 without that much time wasted when my wife begins her coding bootcamp. 

Once that happens the household income will drop about $15k/year, but I plan to pick up a part time job so that we could have a 6-12 month fund during BS3. Looking forward to updates if we make progress faster than estimated. But all in all, I'm glad to have found Dave Ramsey and his advice. Can't wait to have our mini debt free scream, and follow it up with a nice glass of whiskey.",0
t3_bx9vhd,"Just discovered the baby steps, and I’m all out of order.","I recently discovered Dave Ramsey’s baby steps, and was pleasantly surprised that my intuition has brought me pretty close to his guidance. Would love to get some perspective on how someone who already does some of the steps but not others should prioritize moving forward. 

I (27F) have ~$8k emergency fund/3-6 months expenses, ~$40k 401k, ~$12k undergraduate loans. I already contribute 14% to the 401k and 1% of every paycheck to a Roth IRA. 

My husband and I are getting married, and I currently live in his house. I’m also going to grad school without taking on any debt (employer pays half, I pay the other half with cash). 

How important is order? I’m guessing I shouldn’t really reduce my 401k contribution, right? Should I take money out of my emergency fund to pay off the undergraduate loans?",0
t3_bx9mtq,Thinking about calling Dave...,"This month I’ll make my last payment on my credit cards ($7750 done!). But I have 2 major debts before the house. And I’m wondering if I should refinance the home. 

I have a 5.5k FHA loan (0 interest) next on my list. This has to be paid back before I can refinance. 

And 38.2k in student debt. 

I currently pay mortgage insurance because of the FHA loan (about $100/month). Ugh. 

I read total money makeover so I know that it takes a couple years to make the savings back. 

Here’s my 3 options: 
1. Pay the 5.5k back, refinance, and kick the student loans in the butt. 
2. Pay the 5.5k (because it’s the next lowest) and jump into my student loan beating. 
3. Student loans, and tackle the house all at once.

t3_bx5uyi,Tempted to buy an SUV on babystep #2,"But it's safer .. .

OK folks. I'm on baby step #2. I owe family $62,000 and maybe another $6,000 in medical bills. I make $180,000 and have another $45,000 post tax coming in from a severance deal.

A very nasty hail storm totaled my mid 2000 Toyota Sequioa (214,000 miles) which I got because of its safety, reliability and price. I've got 3 kids under 10. I'll get $5k back from insurance. I have $20,000 in an emergency fund because of the severance I can use to buy some of part of the car although need about $6k to pay for a move to the new city i am in (new job 3 months ago).

I have been looking at Sequioas below $10k and am struggling to find a reliable one. I found one from a dealership for $18,000. It's 2010 with 130,000 miles.

I'm certain Dave would say to buy a beater and pay off debts. I have a corporate job so want a decent vehicle and I do prefer high safety and larger SUV's.

I'm tempted to buy this Sequioa although wanted a realty check from one of the best Reddits I know.

Advice? What would you buy in place of the Sequioa?

None of these people know that I’m following Dave’s plan or on BS3, or that I completed FPU. The only people I’ve shared that with are close friends and family. 

So how I’ve reacted thus far is by saying things like, “That’s interesting.” “I’ve never thought about it that way before.” or “I’ll have to google that and read up on it.”

This years tax return was used to pay my car loan and purchase a new mattress as my wife and I were having very uncomfortable times sleeping on an old tempurpedic. With that said here is my situation.

My wife and I currently live in a house that my father and I completely renovated as we got the house from the bank as a foreclosure. I handle all of the home bills except for the mortgage which is around $650/month. My parents agreed to help us out given we care for my mother (Parkinson’s Disease), this would allow us to purchase another home that would allow us to have the room to grow as a family.

A year later my mother unexpectedly passed away and we are still actively looking for a home.

Our debt encompasses a car loan and wife student loans. I have 600 in CC debt that has no interest on it. My wife’s student loans are about 20k and car loan is 10.5k

Sadly under circumstances I wish were different my wife and I received 15k from my mother...

After paying my CC debt off I am wondering if I should simply pay the car loan off, as we are actively looking for a home because well we are out of space...

t3_bwu95q,When to settle with a down payment versus saving money for another year while renting.,"I just started listening to Dave Ramsey and read The Total Money Makeover but I am having trouble deciding what the best decision will be in my situation, and it happens to be regarding the one topic that Dave seems gives some leeway on (taking on a mortgage). My wife and I are newly debt free and are on baby steps 3 and 3b (saving for a down payment) as we currently are renting an apartment. Put together a budget for the first time in my life (and actually excited for the challenge of following it and reaping the benefits) and we should be able to save between 40k-50k yearly with that potentially going up with raises.

We are comfortable with staying in this apartment for the next 28 months (14 month leases) with rent being around $900/month ($25,200 over life of lease). In that time we should be able to save between $80k-$100k with the large majority of it being able to go straight to a down payment. Mathematically does it make sense to go ahead and take the leap and buy a house at that time, or save another $50k with another 14 month and spending another $14k in rent (assuming rent is up to around $1000/month by then? What is the easiest way to go through this math exercise? If it makes any difference our budget for a home is around $250k and fully plan on doing a 15-yr fixed rate mortgage as Dave suggests.

t3_bwqr49,Using E fund to pay down mortgage (eliminate PMI)?,"I have about 14k in my E fund (nearly complete with BS3 @ 6 months of expenses). I have an FHA mortgage purchased in 2012 which carries an $85/month MIP/PMI (its actually MIP, but most people call it PMI). 

I'm only 6k away from paying down the mortgage to 78% LTV where the lender (US Bank) has to stop charging it. 

I've considered refinancing to a 15 year fixed conventional, but it wouldn't lower my interest rate (3.5%) much at all and once you factor in closing costs, it doesn't seem worth it. 

It will take me a year or more to pay the additional 6k on the mortgage based on my current forecast. I could sacrifice more to pay it off sooner, but I don't want to it. We've been at this a LONG time. 

14k is more than I've ever had liquid at one time, which is great, but it also feels a bit strange to me. I've never had an emergency costing more than 5k (hospitalization of my son), and we would still have 3 months in the bank. I have a very secure job. 

I feel like investing the 6k in my mortgage at a rate of return of my interest rate, PLUS saving $1000 on MIP payments for the next year is a wise use of the money. That extra $85/mo would help to rebuild the e fund.

I did, and it got me out of a jam.

One thing I vehemently disagree with Dave on is the adequacy of a $1k e-fund. I've always said it is insufficient for homeowners, primary breadwinners, parents, etc. So, I keep a $10k e-fund. It's not quite 3 months of expenses, but it will over most contingencies.

Well, last week our plumbing backed up. I had recently snaked the septic inlet line, so I knew it wasn't that. I dug up the septic tank and surprise, it's not draining. I called my friend who owns a septic service company and had him come take a look at it. It turns out my leach field lines are plugged with sludge and tree roots. I need a total replacement of the system, and it will run $10k.

I used my e-fund and moved on with my life. Had I listened to Dave I'd be either going into more debt or running to the gas station at the corner to use the bathroom until I could save the money to replace the system.

I guess my point is Dave's system is great for alot of people and has something to offer everyone. But don't follow it blindly with no regard for your unique situation.

EDIT: I should have been more clear that this all happened while I am in BS 2. According to Dave's plan, I should have had $1k to cover this.",0

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a long over due update but here its.

First I just want to say thank you to all the helpful comments and encouragement and brutal honesty on my last post. It sincerely helped. I'm still at my wits end, but I'm a little more fired up and determined to push back. Secondly it's been a busy couple of weeks with trying to sell my truck and my best friends wedding, so I've only had a few moments to listen to a Dave Ramsey youtube video on his seven steps, and I've only really gotten maybe 20 minutes in but still HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIT IS THIS GUY BLOWING MY MIND. I just became his number one fan, especially after he made a joke about a transmission going out and having savings and it not being too bad versus the world ending with no savings (yeah, that one hurt a little). Seriously though, why isn't this stuff being taught in school? I haven't used calculus in years but these baby steps would've been great to know years ago. which brings me the third thing, my present situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to sell the truck. It seems to have a broken head gasket which is more then I can afford to fix. I've looked on kelly blue book and posted it with what I feel like is a decent and fair price for its condition on the Facebook market. My hope is the money i get from selling it, combined with my savings (I have baby step one down, and as much as it'll suck to be back at step zero again, I think this constitutes the rainy day Dave was talking about) I can get a decent enough car that I can rely on for hopefully a year or so. At least until I'm in a spot where I can make car payments. I'm lucky to be able to rely on friends to get to work and back. But I'm hoping this will all be finished with soon because its been a nightmare trying to coordinate everything. I've had few serious bites on the truck, but it seems like I keep getting ghosted even after we agree to a price and shake hands. Its pushing me to just post it for dirt cheap and just get what I can get, but I'm trying to be patient. All the same I need something soon, because I have another wall closing in; I have to move soon. The lady I live with (she's the mother of the friend who just got married actually, good family friend) is listing the house on the market middle of June. There's no guarantee it'll sell fast, but her realtor is telling her similar houses in the area have been selling quick, which is great news for her but not for me. All the same it's high time I moved out and start paying rent somewhere, but with my current financial situation, I don't know if i can do it really at all. I have two friends who want me to move in with them into an apartment, the cost would be about 550 per month (hopefully) after utilities. Its a lot to juggle at once, but at the same time there's a third ball in the air I'm trying to bounce; I REALLY need a new job. As you will see in the spreadsheet I've posted below that details my income and debts (just getting ready for step 2), My serving job is not only giving me barely any hours, but also the money isn't good. It used to be, but with summer and competing for hours and tables with all the servers that came back from college its a fight pit just to get more then three shifts a week. All the same its becoming very apparent that management is even sabotaging our efforts to make dough whether intentionally or not. So this coming week I'll be putting out applications to other serving jobs, but at the same time continue to apply like hell on Indeed and Glassdoor for jobs that use my experience and may have an actual salary and benefits. Although I don't have high hopes of that turning anything up as I've already been doing so for 5 months to no success. And either a salaried job or another serving job, they're gonna ask if I have reliable transportation to work, and I don't currently. See my catch 22?

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like a lot of problems can be solved or at least dealt with if I got a better job, but I can't do that without a new (to me) car, which I can't do unless I'm making actual money. And then the needing to move guillotine is slowly coming down.  So I'm back here asking this kind community ""what would Dave Ramsey do?""

Edit: I forgot to mention this, but in my last post a lot of people went through my post history and made some comments based off hat they saw (kinda creepy but I did post it to the internet so who can I really be upset at). As far as my cannabis use, while it was helpful, I haven't purchased any in almost two months and truthfully haven't regretted it. I exchange my weekly purchase in that for a gym membership i pay for only once a month so no regrets there. And as far as my computer goes, I'm not selling it. As an artist, it's a tool I need. Also the ability to play the games I have on it is a great escape and stress relief to me. If it gets to defcon 5, maybe I'll reconsider, but even then I won't get much money for it and it'll only be a temporary fix and then I'll be right back where I'm at.",0
t3_bwc3zv,"Overspending, $0.00 Debt, Millenial","I have been familiar with Dave Ramsey since I was a child - my mother made me put my allowance in envelopes and this maybe lasted a total of 2 months because at the end of the day, I was a spender. I have always struggled to save money despite my mother's fantastic example I grew up with. I have continued to struggle with materialism - spending usually occurs within the realm of clothes, shoes, accessories, etc. I really enjoy fashion. The reality is that this is all a game to impress others, as Dave says. I have been married for 3 years and we have struggled with poor spending habits, however, we are so lucky to have ZERO debt. We have no car payments, we live in an apartment, have no undergraduate college debt (although I am currently in grad school and pay for this without a loan), and make approximately $60,000 among my husband and I together a year. We have created budgets in the past, but do not stick to them. We have tried and failed - too many times to count. I recently hit a point where I was ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"", also as Dave says. I recognize our situation is different than many of the stories heard on Dave's show and in his books, however, I believe (AND KNOW) my husband and I should be in SUCH a better financial place than we are. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, we have NO DEBT. If we were following our budget that we created many a years ago, our savings should be growing and we should be working towards a down payment for a home. Instead, we have over-spent on entertainment, clothing, travel, and other items through the use of our savings. Couple this with now paying for my graduate degree, the account is getting lower and lower. I told myself last week that this was it. I am OVER IT. Instead of just day-dreaming about our goals, I'm ready to make them happen. Something that's been on my mind is Dave's ""radical""/ Gazelle Intense discussion - With no debt, how ""radical"" should my husband and I get? I wouldn't mind looking for an additional side gig - babysitting (as I was a nanny in college). At the end of the day, I'm looking for advice from you all who perhaps have been in a similar situation. Some items that I've recently been questioning if we should eliminate to get back on track:

\*Therapy &amp; Psychiatry appointments ($400 a month)

t3_bw5roh,"Getting close, but fear and worry is killing me spiritually and financially....","I just dumped $7k and paid my car off and in the next couple months I'll be dumping $10k to pay the last of my school loans, and I have $195k+ left on my home. The biggest thing I struggle with is my job security though, and it's eating me alive.

I'm a 24 year old Product Development Engineer and I make $70,000/yr from my job, plus about $5,000 from private contracting in KY.  I work for an extremely well known consumer goods brand, and I've heard from everyone that they're extremely stable, but I still worry every week that I'm not performing well and that everyone is just lying to me and will blindside me by letting me go out of the blue.

I go into work everyday thinking about all the stuff I'm trying to learn (I moved I into homegoods 8 months ago from consumer electronics) so I still feel like I know nothing about my job, and I leave work dissatisfied with the mistakes I make and the fact that I really feel like I have zero clue what I'm doing. It's causing me stockpile way more money than I need for emergencies.

Anyone have experience with this feeling?

EDIT:

Thank you everyone for the very knowledgeable and kind words or encouragement and advice!  I didn't expect this, and even though today was probably the roughest day I've had yet, I kept re-reading the replies and trying to keep a level head and spiritual approach to this!  Again, thank you all for the encouragement, and I have a lot of great suggestions to point me in a better direction now!",0
t3_bw5khz,Just Married and working BS2,"Hello all, just wanted to put this out because my husband and I are thrilled about where we are. 
I lost my job in October, with ~$62k in student loans. In November, I told my fiancé (at the time) that I wanted to learn more about Dave Ramsey and the baby steps (he’d been raving about Dave’s podcast to me for the better part of a year). I was at the end of my rope emotionally, and was trying to understand what to do while on unemployment.   We read the total money makeover together and got set on a budget in December. I found part time work in December (PRN, so I was able to get a lot of hours and make up for lost time), and temporary full time work in January. In February I found a full time gig making more money than before, and I have kept working the PRN job to attack the debt. 
We got married last week, and my husband put in his emergency fund to my student loans. Starting in October with $62k, we are down to $28k this month, with the plan of finishing up BS2 by 31 December. We are continuing to refine our budget process, but the biggest impetus to change has been good spending behaviors. I can’t wait to pay off the debt, after which we plan to take a much needed honeymoon/congratulatory vacation, then on to BS3, downpayment on the house, and BS4-6! 
Working the baby steps and following Dave’s advice/principles gave me back a sense of control over my life in a trying time, and because we’ve had these discussions/hardships during our engagement, we are going into our marriage with a plan to fight for our financial freedom (and WIN)!",0

t3_bvzzs6,Baby Step 3 DONE!!! 🎉,"Please don’t read if you’re needing inspiration....lol




Weird thing is I don’t feel as jubilant as I thought I would. Sure, I feel safer, (if disaster strikes, I’m ok), but there is no sense of relief. Maybe it’s because I know I will have a jillion sinking funds so I’m going to still feel broke?! Maybe it’s because I still have $104k left on my mortgage? Maybe it’s because this feeling of not having enough money just doesn’t go away. When does it go away? When does this “money coming out of my ears” thing happen?

I have a good income ($95k) so I don’t understand why I feel broke. Maybe it’s because I am used to spending freely and a “travel” sinking fund feels like a constraint? I think alotting $10k to overdue home improvements over the next year while aggressively saving for a new car at the same is the culprit. Maybe wait another year on improvements or do half the amount?

Can some BS4-6 folks please let me know how they handled this period of their journey? When did you finally start to feel some freedom from financial constraints? Thanks.",0

Looking for some Dave advice.

24yo, just hired for first teaching job. Doesn’t start till August, unemployed till then.

12k in debt, I’ll make about $40-45k

Obviously I’m going to throw everything I can to get out of debt this year.

My debt doesn’t start accruing interest until October because I paid off my loans that rack up interest while I’m in school already.

Wondering, should I start investing now? If I’m for sure gonna have extra money to put somewhere while I know I can get out of debt by the end of the year? Really wanna get rolling on investing as early as possible and would hate to wait till I’m totally out of debt, but that might be what I should do!

t3_bw7gx7,Should I sell car?,"Hi guys, 

I stupidly committed to car financing before I discovered Dave.

I’m not sure what to do. I have 28 months remaining on my car loan with a balance of around £6000 still to pay. The car is worth about £9000.

Should I sell the car to get rid of the debt and use the £3000 to buy an old car which may be unreliable etc. or should I just stick with the car I have and try to pay it off faster?

The car I have absolutely guzzles fuel and is expensive in that regard.

Any help would be apprectiated.

Edit - I also have around £1000 in an investment account, should I use some of that money to pay off a small part of the car, or put it towards a new car along with the other £3000?",0
t3_bw06zv,Paying off Student Loans,"Hi there!

I’m in BS2 and so far I’ve paid off a small credit card and am now paying off a $2000 car loan. 

As it stands, I was planning to pay off my credit cards next ($4000 balance &amp; $8000 balance) and then start in on my student loans (4 loans with a total balance of $16000)

I was just poking around on the website for my loans and realized that it is possible to pay them off one by one instead of paying the payment with an average of their interest rates being applied. The loans individually range from $3000 - $5000.

Should I look at these loans individually and insert them into my snowball in that order?? Or keep the order I originally thought of $4000 &gt; $8000 &gt; $16000? I’m realizing that breaking them up may actually give me more momentum in this process. The only thing is, I’m not sure I can make smaller payments on the student loans individually...

What do you guys think? Does anyone have experience with this?",0
t3_bw05be,Did anyone else do BS2 before BS1?,"So I’m 24 years old and just am just starting to pay off around 8k of debt (mix of credit debt/student loans). I’m already on monthly payment plans for most of the largest ones, and have paid off one of the smaller ones in full. I just became familiar with this subreddit and noticed that the first step that is recommended though is to save 1000 in savings. The only thing is though, with my next paycheck I can either start working towards that 1000 savings, or I can use it and it’ll completely pay off another one of the smaller debt balances in full. 

Does anyone have any advice or thoughts on if I should continue towards paying off the debt, and hold off on the savings for now? Has anyone done it that way and what was your experience?",0
t3_bw35kl,Teachers... help me understand what to do with my 403(b)?,"I've been a public school teacher for 3 years in MA and am moving on from my school &amp; state in a month.

I've been in baby step 2 and before that honestly paid little attention to my retirement fund, mainly since I'm young.

I couldn't stop my retirement fund during baby step 2 because in MA it is required (since it replaces our social security tax, I believe). I just basically budgeted my paycheck for the past year.

Now that I am moving on... what should I do? Leave it there? Dave had told someone else on the air to roll theirs into an IRA (they were not a teacher though). A friend suggested I keep it there so that if I come back to teaching (which is likely for me), I just need to put in a few more years before I could use it and have the benefits come retirement.

So after my fiancee who had been leasing her entire adult life went out and leased a new 2018 Durango, I went to the dealership that I work for and got what I thought was a hell of a deal on a 2018 Lexus RX350. I traded my pickup in which was worth about 26k for 26k wiping the debt clean, and lowering my payments to under 700 a month. But we want to get debt free asap.

Or would it be smarter to not take such a large hit (about 9k) and then in 4 years when my lease is up just wipe my hands clean? If we get out and get me a beater then we would pay off that 9k in about 13 months, then do the same with my fiancees car. Or am I crazy??",0
t3_bvy749,Investing Question,"Hey everyone, 

I had a quick question here! 

My understanding is that you can only contribute $6,000 to a Roth IRA each year and that makes since to me. My question is what if you want to buy index funds but you’ve already maxed out your Roth IRA (I don’t have access to a 401K, so that’s off the table)? 

This is more for my own knowledge, than what I’d actually do. I still have a mortgage payment, so I would probably take any extra funds (after maxing my Roth IRA out) and start paying the house off as fast as possible. 

It’s just the other day I was listening to Dave and someone called in and said they had a large lump sum of cash upwards of 100K that they were getting from a cashed out life insurance policy, but the young woman didn’t need the money now but didn’t know what to do. Dave suggested she invest the money in mutual funds ... Am I missing something? If you’re capped at $6,000 how would she invest the rest? 

Any help would be awesome, thanks for your time!",0
t3_bvspto,"BS 2 Progress - $42,569 in debt","I am 32 and my wife is 24. Both have full time jobs making about $135,000 yearly house hold income. We were slaves to debt. 

We started on February 22nd of this year after stumbling on Dave Ramsey's youtube channel while looking for videos on investing. Here's where we stood:

* $2,369 Student loan #1
* $2,800 Personal loan
* $6,000 Personal loan (family loan, interest free)
* $7,100 Student loan #2
* $8,300 Roof loan
* $16,000 Car loan

For a grand total of $42,569!

...and I thought we were in good shape since we had $13,000 in our savings account...

Since then we have been able to pay all but $6,300 on the car loan and $4,000 on one of the personal loans. We should be DEBT FREE by the end of the September, with the car done in August. 

It works folks, it really does. Thank goodness I found Dave! It's a shame I didn't find him in my twenties, I could have avoided TONS of stupid mistakes.

t3_bvwhwb,BS2 or BS3?,"My wife and I are trying to decide which Baby Step we are in.  

Here's the situation:
* We paid off all consumer debt over a year ago with the exception of a home equity loan.
* Our house was paid off before we got the home equity loan and we have no other debt than the HEL.
* We took out the HEL to pay off student loans for both our children and some small debt we had (401k loan, overdraft protection, and medical debt).
* We had co-signed on their student loans and they were missing payments so we were being hounded by the creditors.
* We have been living on a budget for over a year and taken on no additional debt.  In fact, we have (together) successfully resisted various urges to do so.
* We are making double payments on the HEL (one to principal only) when we can.
* We're using Everydollar and regularly discussing our budget together.

So, the question is, should we consider the HEL as consumer debt or mortgage?  We are both 56 yo and I'm ready to start back investing at 15%.",0

The question: I'm an only child and my only living parent (age 73, currently healthy) lives out of state. I am worried that $1,000 won't be enough to get there in a hurry (via a flight instead of a 15 hour drive) *and* cover incidentals should an emergency medical issue pop up. Because of this, would it be wise to put more money in my EF while in BS2? I am thinking $3,000 is a safer amount, but I don't have to save all that all at once. I am thinking I will get to $1,000 and re-start BS2, but maybe throw $20 per paycheck into my EF and let it slowly accumulate to a larger amount. I know this takes momentum away from BS2, but this is one of those unpredictable but predictable type situations as well because eventually I feel like this will happen. It might not be tomorrow, but it could happen in a year or 2 years or 5 years. Thanks for any advice!",0

t3_bvdqa8,"$91,000 Debt-free Squeak","As of today, we have paid off our entire credit card debt of $91,000.  We incurred this debt when our baby was born, since I was so sleep-deprived and brain-fogged that I could not work at my business (or at least, couldn't work without making serious mistakes that cost us money), and my spouse was only working at half-capacity at best.  We were both self-employed at the time, and we barely made any money for a year.

After the baby turned one, my sleep got better and I began to recover.  By the time she turned two, we found a good part-time daycare and I got back to normal work.  At about this time last year, I got a part-time job that paid very well (really lucked out there), we got our budget in order, and we really got on with killing off that debt.  The debt-repayment journey has been very educational, mostly for my spouse (who was a financial hot mess when we met, and who had no money-management skills).  There were arguments and fights along the way, it was not always easy, but no matter what, we did not incur new debt and we stayed on-plan.  I now keep an eagle eye on our finances.  We got Mint to manage our money and I look at it every day and make sure that we are still on plan.  

This is not a debt-free scream, because we still owe about $40,000 to the IRS and my spouse has (get ready for it) about $350,000 of student loans.  But I think that killing off $91,000 of credit card debt is at least worthy of a partial debt-free scream - hence my title.

Wife and I are on BS3 and have been here for about a year now. Has been a very rewarding trip through the first 2 steps, and was beyond pumped up to knock out BS3, but we are now in a rut. 

Over the year, we have saved up 2900 of 15k in the first 3 months, and have been stalled there for quite a while, I have sold everything that is not necessity, and am now trying to sell things that could be considered useless and have had no luck. My career requires me a minimum 12 hour 6 days a week, I offer repair services outside of work to bring extra income but with the time required at work, those services are quite hindered. Each paycheck I get is enough to pay our way and usually we have about 30 bucks to save, which is great, I guess my point is this is getting to feel like a 20 year effort to finish BS3 and maybe that's normal, but, it's kind of killing my enthusiasm with such slow results.

My wife is unavailable to work. I could get a 2nd job at night but, 3 kiddos and a home to maintain, I'm not convinced the trade-off is worth it.

Hopefully I'm making sense here, just trying to spill my brain out. Also I hope this does not come off as whining, really not looking to do that, I still have the goal in mind and am aware it's not easy. If anyone is or has been in this position, what are some things you have done or are doing to boost the income?

t3_bvjy6w,BS2: Student Loan Interest,"Hello,

We're in BS2 and our only debts are my wife and I's student loans.  I am graduated and making the minimum monthly payments (my balance is larger), and my wife is about a year from her masters.

My question is, since we both have accrued interest on our loans, would it be best to treat those as separate line items on our spreadsheet and pay those off as quickly as possible so that the larger principal balances do not go up so much each month?

Everything was fine until I mentioned we should add me to the bill pay and savings so I can transfer/split my pay to each “envelope” as soon as it hits the joint account. I get paid weekly so I thought it would be best for me to keep up with that since he’s out of town often not always in an area that has network/service. He immediately said “that’s not happening” and ended the conversation. 
I don’t even know what we have in savings since I can’t access the account. I used to be okay with it but it frustrates me now. Especially since I’m making more money than he is and our joint is now zeroed out. A friend told me I should open a separate savings and divert a percentage of my bonuses to it as a safety net in case something happens to him and I don’t have access to those accounts right away but that seems shady. 

I’m sorry this is so long and I’m rambling. I’m just frustrated and need some help fixing this.

I have been looking forward to writing this post all month.

&amp;#x200B;

**This month has been a record month for us paying off a big chunk of our debt.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Amazing things that happened:

1. We have paid a total of **$10,179.95** to our total debt owed this month!!!!
2. We paid a total of $9,255.09 to the IRS. $6,255.09 was to help clear back taxes. 2017 is all paid off!! 2018 only has a little over $6k left AND we also paid $3k to estimated taxes. For the first time in my business career, I am managing my taxes responsibly -- this is HUGE progress for me. 
3. We paid off all medical bills!! Our line items have dropped from 11 different debts to 8!! Wow, that feels so good to realize. 
4. I made a commitment to sell something on Facebook marketplace and ended up making $256 for literally 10 mins of my time (they all came to my apartment clubhouse!) I have lots more to sell so I am pumped about that.
5. We cash flowed an additional $1,174.14 in wedding expenses (flights, 1 bridesmaid dress + alterations, suit).

&amp;#x200B;

Things to tweak for next month:

1. We are going on a family vacation (long-scheduled) and I really do not want to spend anything at all. Our parents are treating us to a few meals but then we are just buying groceries. We are not buying any hiking shoes or gear or anything we normally might for our first hiking vacation. 
2. We do have an additional $1,025 in wedding expenses. So I really want to just tighten the reins everywhere else and cut expenses wherever I can. 
3. I would LOVE to pay the rest of the IRS next month. Which would mean I would need to earn an EXTRA $6k in June in order to make that happen. That currently feels a little tricky because I will be gone for 11 days on this vacation. I would cancel the vacation but we have already committed and my parents have paid an exorbitant amount of money to make it happen. 
4. I would love to see if I can make an extra $1000 on FB marketplace, I think that would be so cool if I could. 
5. My husband is getting a bonus of $1000 and we are using that to replace his broken computer. (He needs it for his side hustle (video editing) so he will actually be able to make money again which justifies the cost to me.)
6. I feel like I would love to think of some ways to cut costs in my budget this month: see link below:

t3_bvceui,Match up to employer 401k even while on BS2?,"Hey all.

My wife and I are working on bs2.  My employer matches 100% of the first 3% 401k and 50% on the second 3%. 

So I need to put 6% of my paycheck to get their 4.5% match.

t3_bvgkuy,What would Dave say?,"Just curious...

If you are active duty military and planning on staying in for a while, when would be a good time to buy a house? (Aside from his usual rules for house buying e.g. payments no more than 25% of take home pay, etc.) I heard Dave say a few days ago that “renting should not be a lifestyle.” I’ve also heard him say it’s a terrible idea every time someone brings up being a long distance landlord. 

Let’s say you bought a house at your current duty station that you planned to come back to upon retiring, and rented it out so when you do come back, most/all of it is paid for. 

Has Dave addressed any of these situations before? What do you guys think he would say?",0

- grocery shop &amp; food prep

t3_bvedn3,Should I pull from my emergency fund?,"Hello all, to give you background I am 20 and have about 5-6k in my emergency fund. I have no debts, one car and one motorcycle. However, my car engine is burning a lot of oil and is on the way out (99 civic), plus it has no AC, and I live in Florida. In summer. Anyway, I just put 1k into rebuilding the suspension, and was about to save for a swap (2,000 dollars) when the time was right, but then something happened: 

My girlfriend bought a Mazda Miata 5 speed. And I drove it and loved it.

And I have to say, I don't care about swapping the Civic anymore. I want a Miata so bad, but don't think it is very smart to pull $3500 from my fund to buy a car when I have one that *still works (until it blows up), plus I have a moderately-reliable sportbike. Should I sell the Civic (probably for 1.5k) and buy the car or use the Civic until it dies? I'm a car enthusiast so Its important that I get the car, but I want to make sure that I do it properly with my finances in check. I do have money in investments as well as a 401(k), but I'm not touching those at all. What would you do? 

Note: On 'Scorched earth' diet, I can save around 1k a month.",0
t3_bvcogp,Objective method of determining when to give up on a car?,"I have a cash car that I got at a good price, I won't say exactly it as from what I know so far, that figure wouldn't be considered in deciding whether or not to keep it. KBB values it at 2600-3937. I will guess at 2600 because it is very ugly has a lot of dents, hood flew up, etc. 

The air conditioning is out, and I live in the southeast. I'd say its a necessity. A mechanic said he'd start with the condenser and compressor- this is at $1300.  There are a couple of other things wrong with it that come out to about $600 in additional repairs.

I also assume that its value increases in the winter because of this problem, so if I were to sell it, it would have to be in the winter. 

I can't afford to save up for another car right now as my wife will be delivering our child by the end of July.",0
t3_bvbzog,Processing gift during BS2,"So, it’s a long backstory, and honestly I’m not sure that it really matters, but has anyone received a substantial financial gift during your BS2 journey that has helped eliminate part of your debt? How do you process this? Don’t get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful for God providing in this way. It isn’t going to completely eliminate my debt, but it will make a substantial dent. 
Just don’t know how to mentally/emotionally process this. I will say that there are other personal things going on that are kind of piling on top of this, so I think it’s everything combined.....

I am about to be done with baby step 3 and I’m confused about 4...

I have a 401k with a former employer 
I am not Eligible for my new employer’s 401k until 2020.

I talked with an ELP but I kind of forget what he said...

Should I roll over my 401k into an IRA with the ELP and start a new 401k acct with my new employer in 2020? They match 4% - not entirely sure what that means.

If I am contributing 15% of my gross income, should I put it all into my new 401k or split between IRA and 401k? The IRA would be managed by the ELP. My 15% would be $6,500/yr.

My husband just wants to put his 15% in his vanguard Roth IRA and not use the ELP, but he’s fine with me using the ELP.

t3_buygwg,Feeling like it is impossible? Check your withholding elections.,"Dave talks about this quite a bit, but since starting a new job 7 months ago I hadn’t really sat down to figure out how many allowances I should take. I was at 2 (which was my best guess when starting, and knowing I was buying a house). I ran the calculator and found I should be withholding 7! (Given how much I’ve been taxed so far this year, anticipated pay, anticipated itemized deductions, etc.). I changed it to 6 just to be safe. My paycheck is probably going to go up a couple hundred dollars which is huge for me right now as I’m riding the struggle bus to stick to my budget. Now I don’t have to be quite as insanely restrictive. 

Just remember everyone’s tax situation is different, so run the IRS W-4 withholding calculator.",0
t3_butnes,Withdrew contributions from my Roth IRA to pay off car. Simple step but debt free.,"I don't have an amazing debt free story like most people on here, but in case people might be unaware you can withdrawal your contributions to a Roth IRA anytime without penalty or taxes, since your contributions have already been taxed.  

Withdrawal of earnings on the other hand would be taxed and penalized, so it's important to track your basis.

My quick story, I discovered Dave 6 months ago, and i had just paid off my student loans after a dozen years of payments (wish I found his lessons sooner).  I also had an aversion to credit card debt so I had none. I just had a monthly car payment of $350.

After I discovered Dave I started throwing $500 a month at the car payment. Then after doing the math realized I could withdrawal $5k from my Roth and combine it with savings to get rid of the remaining $10k car loan (and still have a 3 month emergency fund).  

Instead of throwing $500 a month at a car I'm now putting an extra $250 a month on my mortgage and I've upped my Roth contributions from $200 to $500 a month.  The $5k withdrawal was in Feb, so by December I'll have completely replenished that account.

Just wanted to share in case people were not aware of this possibility.",0
t3_buia57,11 Month Update!!!," 

Hey guys. Here's my 11 month update! I mainly do this for myself to keep a log and keep myself motivated.

Total Starting Debt: $49,700

Last Month Debt: $12,600

Total Current Debt: $10,400

Target Debt Free Date: 10/01/2019

Income: $70k

\-Year one : Pay off debt

\-Year two : Save 3-6 months salary. Save $20k+ for a house

\-Year three : Save $30k+ for a house

\-Year four: Save another $30k+. Put a down payment on a house, get roommates to help pay majority of the mortgage, save for a car with cash, profit.",0
t3_buw7e1,How do you do your cash budget?,"Let me start out by saying, I’ve always been a cash budgeter and I do budget every dollar by paycheck. However, I used to just take out a lump some of cash each pay day and use that money for whatever I needed until the next paycheck. Mainly I would use the money to get groceries, coffee shop trips, fun money, eating out, things I needed for the house etc. I’ve always been very good about knowing a want vs a need and saving up for a want (or deciding I didn’t need it). When the money was gone then I was SOL until the next pay period. I usually never spent the entire amount (usually $300) and would put any leftover into my savings account. I would always keep receipts and know where my money went. However this January I started to be more specific with my money. I bought a mini file folder and labeled each column with things like groceries, medical, hygiene, house, cat, etc. I put a specific amount of money into each fund, when it’s gone it’s gone and again I keep receipts etc. Any leftover money I just keep in their respective columns. My problem is I find myself borrowing money from one fund to cover another sometimes. I can only get multiples of $20 or $100 at the ATM and my bank has no tellers. So for example last week I bought something that would have been spent from my house fund, however I did not have the entire amount I needed in that column as I had used some before. So, I decided to use part of my blow money to cover the rest. In that instance I couldn’t give the cashier all my house fund and then part of my blow money, as I only had a big bill in my blow fund. So I ended up just using my entire blow fund and none of the house fund. It was really frustrating. I don’t know how to borrow from one fund and pay myself back so to speak. Should I continue to keep trying this method or go back to my lump sum?",0

As far as I've understood, ETF's don't experience turnover because of how their priced/traded throughout the day, so wouldn't that make ETF's the best mid-term investment tool **by Dave's standards (from a tax-advantage standpoint)**?

t3_bun3xw,Keep or Sell my car?,"Quick introduction to my situation;

Single, 33 years old, no kids, no mortgage (we'll discuss that).

Salary - $50k/yr - $3k a month after taxes - I am not salaried yet, still hourly so I am pulling as much OT as I can. It's about 10-20 hrs every two weeks at $36/hr

I'm $83k in debt.

Credit Card - $5,800 @ 15.9% - $170/mo min payment

Car - $28,500 @ 5.5% - At least $8,500 upside down - $486/mo min payment

Student Loans - $48,500 - Payment plan, currently $33/mo min payment

Baby step - 1

I am current on \*ALL\* payments.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I recently (last week) discovered and started listening to Dave after hearing about his book (Total Money Makeover) on r/personalfinance. I'm currently saving my starter $1k emergency fund, have a budget in place that is a work in progress and am going through the work book. As i stated earlier, I have no mortgage/rent because I live with, and take care of my 92yr old widowed grandmother in a paid off house.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wrestling with how to best tackle this debt of mine. Now, I know Dave preaches the snowball technique however I think I may be in a bit of a unique situation. You see, I'm about $8,500 upside down on my car and its debt is over 50% of my total income. KBB says its worth between $20-21.5k and I owe $28,500 on it. I am up in the air if I should just sell the car, get a personal loan for the negative equity and attack that as fast as possible. If I could do that, I could afford to pay $1500 a month on that negative equity which would get me out of it in 5.5 months. That would leave me with about $1500 a month to live on, or $750 every two weeks which is plenty for me given my living situation. After that, I would attack my credit card in the same manner and then move onto my student loans. If I kept up the $1500 towards my student loans I'd be completely debt free in about 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I am fortunate to live in a town where I could take an 18 minute bus ride to work, or bike to work when it's nice. There is plenty of public transportation for me to use, however it would require a big life style change for me which makes me a little nervous as I've never not had a vehicle. I figure my other option is to prioritize the car first, and plan to keep it. However between insurance, gas and the payment, I'm already paying $715 a month just to have it so the first ""Payment"" to the balance would be closer to $1k a month which would take me a little over 2.5 years to pay it off completely.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a 2018 with 3k miles - I hate it however because I allowed myself to get screwed over by giving in to my ""I want it now"" mentality. I could however live with it, I just hate being reminded every day of how bad I screwed up. Not to mention, it's not a vehicle I would pick out for myself. My Grandmother does have her own vehicle so if an emergency arose I could user her vehicle if need be as she barely drives anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I sell it, get a personal loan, and go to town on the negative equity while using public transportation?

Do I keep it, pay it off in about 2.5 years and have a car free and clear to drive into the ground?

Do I trade it in for something cheap (less than $5k) roll the negative equity over and attack that debt?

What would Dave do?

t3_bug062,Just keep making mistake after mistake.,"I don't know how you guys do it. I've been trying to do 'baby steps' since 2013.

We just signed a contract with a remodeling company to redo the house, did some research after the fact (instead of before, like a dummy) and turns out we're being way over charged. Ugh. Having buyer's remorse and probably going to cancel, but now have to deal with the credit score hit.

Have $6k in cc debt from planning an international vacation before having cash in hand. Dumb, dumb dumb.

Have $13k in car loans because we 'need a car' and 'i deserve it'.

At least I have my student loans almost paid off ($2.5k left), but my SO's student loans ($27k) will kick in in a couple months.

I just can't seem to reconcile my behavior with my though process. Brain says 'pay off debt', heart says 'i'm fuckin bored YOLO let's travel'. And then I beat myself up over it later.

we don't have as much debt as other people, but we've been stuck on BS2 for 6 years. even with the e-fund, just can't seem to make it go away. i'm already working a side hustle.

any tips or tricks? psychological tricks even? what changed your behavior?

edit: thank you for the advice, tips and encouragement. i've cancelled the remodeling contract as the first step. going to have a serious conversation with my SO so we can be on the same page about this and we can support each other when we get weak and want to go off-track. make a long term plan and stick to it. maybe go to therapy. cancel some subscriptions. read more about being frugal. try to be creative about it. eliminate my credit cards. and put a lot more into paying off debt as a first thing each month instead of spending it. i know it's in me somewhere.  that mean guy said 'grow up', i'm over 30, thought i was grown up but guess i still got work to do.",0
t3_bues23,"Receiving a large sum in a settlement, need advice.","So my fiance just settled a case and is being awarded 80k.

I am the only one of us working (he is physically not able hence the settlement). I can cover all the bills on my own, and we only have the house to pay off, and a small rolling credit card debt that we pay off every month.

I am thinking the best plan for this money coming in is to pay off the house (approx 75k), and then snowball that mortgage payment (\~650/month) into building the emergency fund, retirement funds, etc.  It's a bit out of order, but i think it would be worth it to save several thousand on mortgage interest.

Thanks everyone! It's relieving to have a consensus on this. I just didn't want to make a stupid mistake.",0
t3_buasdg,Murphy Tree Part 2,"Here is an update on the Murphy tree saga...

My husband and I worked our butts off this weekend, trimmed the Murphy tree (as much as safely possible) and took multiple loads of tree debris to the dump. (PSA: avoid the dump on holiday weekends!)

Anyway, the tree guy that the flipper nextdoor knows came and assessed the tree today. We were able to talk him down BIG TIME (= 1/4 of the last bid we got) because a.) We're going to do the hauling, b.) We're going to rent our own stump grinder and do that work eventually, c.) We're being flexible about the date/time the Murphy tree actually goes down (sorry not sorry but my husband will be fake calling out of work... he has hundreds of hours of sick time because he literally never calls out and honestly I don't feel bad.)

This ultimately means that the Murphy Tree and fence will be paid for in cash aaaand even though we can't fully pay off the next credit card that we had originally lined up to *slay* this month, we're still going to pay off about 1/2 of the balance!

I'm soooooo happy and thankful! This whole saving money and paying off credit cards thing is starting to get very addicting. And I like it! 😎",0

t3_bu4xau,Struggling with elderly parents’ finances; what to do,"Hi everyone,

I’m facing a challenging situation and I’m hoping I can get some of your comments, feedback, or perspectives. 

My parents are 70. My mom hasn’t worked in 35 years. My dad made 200k+ for decades. They now don’t have any retirement except social security.  

They owe 50k on credit cards, 25k in taxes due to not paying appropriate amounts when withdrawing from a now empty 401k, and they still owe 300k on their mortgage. 

I’m really struggling here. The mortgage has been going on for 20 years and they still have another 20 to go which to me means they must have refinanced. 

Their monthly expenses including the mortgage are nearly 6k and they have zero income. Very soon they will start collecting social security. My dad wanted to wait until 70 so he got the maximum benefit but that means he’s been using credit cards for the past few years. He lost his job at 65 and hasn’t been able to get another equivalent one. 

Anyway the MAIN thing I’m struggling with is they are asking for money. I’ve given them 13k over the past 6 months, but it’s always a last minute “something will fail” emergency.  This makes it really stressful and hard to plan for. They want me to cover the mortgage. Until things get better. I want to help them but I really feel they’re not managing money right. I have my own school debt I’m paying off. 

I should note I live with them currently. I am paying rent but it’s going to hurt me to pay the mortgage. Also I take up a small space so it’s not like I really use the house. 

I’m trying to help them manage money, but they really aren’t that interested. I’m worried they will just drag me into their black hole of debt. But also I love them and they are kind people. I don’t want my elderly parents to suffer or feel abandoned. It’s really tough. If you have faced a similar situation or have some advice please share. Thanks. 

Ps again I really do care for them so I’m trying to do the right thing. But money and feelings and family seem to be one of the hardest scenarios.",0

Now hubby got a ticket because he forgot to pay for his license when it came in and so an $80 fee has now become $490.

I didn't have the money to pay for one of my 2 kids school items so I still owe them $179.

To top it off, my kids had brought in some mail and put it under some books so I never saw it - and now come tom find our city taxes have come in and were never paid... (new home owners so this isn't something I was thinking about...)

My SO is on board with doing this - but not so much on the sitting with me to do it so I am not being held accountable and have been pushing it off because I am TERRIFIED to go over all we owe...

We put the bulk of our tax return on his credit card (lowest balance) and it made a dent but we still have more to go.

&amp;#x200B;

I NEED to do this - but I am scared... we have lived so long paycheck to paycheck that I always let it slide...

When I think of the money coming in I cannot see how people get so much extra to pay down debt... In my head we have only enough to cover the minimum payments on everything and just tread water... I can't see how we will have extra (but I know that is only because I havent written it all down)

&amp;#x200B;

I will be going DAVISH on the side of the retirement - as we used the home buyers plan to purchase the house we have - and we need to pay that back into our RRSP - so we cannot eliminate that fee - but otherwise I cancelled our subscriptions, and now I need to DO IT.

t3_bu69v7,Am I missing something here?,"I just heard DR say that he ran some complex math formulas and proved that owning a smaller portfolio of rental houses outright is going to cash flow more over 30 years that owning a larger amount of rentals that are leveraged. 

I thought this was pretty cool I tried to run the numbers, but it definitely didn’t come out that way. Unless my math is wrong, if you have $250k cash and use it to buy 5 rentals (50k down on each) vs. buying a single rental outright the 5 rentals are going to cash flow more over the 30 year period as well as you’ll have 5 paid for $250k houses. 

Here’s the math I have:

Home value:
$250,000

Downpayment: 
$50,000

Monthly payment:
$1,254

Monthly Rent income:
$2,200

Cash flow per month:
$946

Expenses per year:
$2,500

Yearly Cashflow:
$8,852

Cashflow over 30 years:
$265,560

X 5 houses = $1,327,800


Cashflow for 1 house worth $250k paid for assuming expenses and rent are the same as the above = $717,000 over 30 years

t3_btg30d,Finally debt free (or close enough)!,"Hey all, I've been holding off for the day that I can make a post here, but now I think I can do it.

Background: I graduated in 2014, and my wife graduated in 2015. We had around 70k in student loan debt, and a 14k loan on a car. Around 2016, we bought a house. After buying the house, we decided to do some home improvement things (new carpet, cosmetic changes), and our siding was leaking inside (so we bought new siding .. 20k). Despite all the expenses, we paid off some of the 'new' expenses pretty quickly. Around this time I was looking at our bank statements to see where our money was going, and was pretty surprised how much we were blowing, yet it felt like there wasn't that much to show for it. I started listening to the Dave Ramsey podcast, which helped give me the motivation to get really intense. 2 years later, and we've got all of our debt paid off (not including the house).

The reason I added (or close enough) to the title is because during the last 2 months of trying to get our debt paid off, we had 2 emergencies come up. My wife needed an appendectomy (8k deductible/out of pocket max), and we had a hailstorm which totaled our roof (3k deductible). We used the money our insurance gave us for the roof to get the medical bills paid off. Now we just need to save up to get the roof taken care of. Technically debt free, but maybe a bit more anticlimactic then I wanted it to be!",0
t3_btgg60,Student Loan Hell,"Hello Dave Ramsey Sub, throwaway account because I am embarrassed at where my life is at and need some advice. Sorry, this will be a long one!

I'll start with how I found out about Dave. I was hosting my family Christmas last year and everyone was having a great time. My brother in law mentioned that he was using the baby steps and he was able to pay off all his credit card debt. Now, I should have been happy right? He is getting out of debt and my sister would be taken care of... well I felt the opposite. I felt jealous. I have always been the one that the rest of my family wanted to be like and I loved that feeling, but my parents and sisters were all so excited about him getting out of debt and I hated him for it. Shortly after, I felt a new emotion. Shame. Not only for feeling that way about my family, but I realized that all the stuff I had didn't matter to my family or friends at all. I had people over and hosted a lot of events, but it was pretty clear in that moment that it's all quickly forgotten as soon as they leave and I am the one holding the bill. I went and bought the total money makeover literally the next day. I wanted to see what everyone in my family was so excited about.

A little background, my fiance and I are probably more well off than most people. We have both worked hard in life and both have graduate degrees. I make about 100k a year and she makes about 85k a year. We have no children and our life is pretty easy for the most part, or so we thought. When I first listened to Dave I realized that we are what he would call financially fat. All we did was spend money but because the money kept rolling in, we never felt the pain. My brother in law and sister make about 80k combine and have 4 kids and have been in pretty rough situation in the past. However, I realized quickly that they were in a better financial position than me. It was a very scary realization. 

So here we are today. I finally sat down and looked at my financial picture. I have no idea where to begin. So here it goes.

My current debts and payments (not including household expenses):

Mortgage - $227,000 - $1,700 per month
Student loan 1 - $97,000 - $500 per month (both student loans are just interest payments currently as I am in a somewhat high COL area)
Student loan 2 - $83,000 - $350 per month
Credit card 1 - $16,500 - $450 per month
Credit card 2 - $15,000 - $350 per month
Credit card 3 - $11,000 - $160 per month
Credit card 4 - $3,600 - $89 per month
Credit card 5 - $3,000 - $160 per month
Credit card 6 - $4,200 - $200 per month
Car loan - $12,000 - $350 per month

So that's the bad news. 

The good news is that after all these minimum payments and other household bills, we have about $1400 per month free before any kind of entertainment, going out to eat, or unexpected items. As you can guess, we usually go through that every month.

Looking at this, the credit cards don't scare me as much as the student loans. I can probably clear the credit cards in a year or 2, but Dave always says student loans before retirement. I am already 30 years old and I can't imagine lowering my retirement contributions for 10 years to 0. That would put me at 40 before I even start! 

Here is where I need advice... Has anyone been in a similar situation? Should I keep my retirment at 10% or so? Should I hold contributions until credit cards are paid and then restart? I don't know if I can get my head around stopping them for 10 years. Any advice?",0
t3_btal94,Murphy Tree,"So my husband and I are on BS2. We paid off our first credit card last month and funded BS1 (= $1500ish to do.) This month we were poised to pay off another credit card (= $2,000ish to do.) We're doing great and I'm so proud of the behavioral changes we've made.

Here's the thing: we live in a townhome and the home nextdoor is being flipped... there's already a buyer lined up (we live in highly desirable area) with sale/contract pending in the next 2 weeks... even before the renovation is actually done!

Anyway: the fence needs to be replaced along the property line. And there's an AWFUL tree that needs to be dropped (on our property, thus our financial responsibility) because the power line is running through it. I feel like these (fence, tree down) are not wants but prudent needs. 

I think that spending cash to drop the tree and replace a fence on a shared property line (the home flipper has offered to install if we go 1/2zees on materials) offers us an opportunity to a.) pick out fencing that isn't shitty... plus we would not have to compromise with future owners on style, design... b.) utilize neighbors yard (if needed) to drop the tree while the nextdoor house/yard is vacant and we are instead working with a relatively easy going and nice contractor vs. who even knows what our future neighbors are going to be like???

I should also mention that our home is fully paid off. We're in debt with credit cards, truck payments, and student loans... funny part is that we paid off our home long before we incurred any of our consumer debt. Even more ironic: we acquired consumer debt to ""establish credit"" because we had been cash only for 10 years prior.  What a mistake! Should have stayed cash only and waited to buy another new home in cash (instead of trying to ""establish credit ughhhh)",0

I make 2606 net a month (band teacher)
Wife makes 2100 net a month (security secretary)

Both cars are older but we own them (I own a 09 Hyundai Accent I’ve owned since HS, 94,000 miles; Wife owns an 07 Cobalt with 110,000 miles)

We are wanting to buy a house, houses in my area are cheaper, are goal is a nice 150k house on a 15 year note ( we should be able to save %10 and about 10k to pad up the emergency fund this year)

I have a lot saved into my teacher pension, wife has 5k in retirement and I have 4K in a Roth IRA (I save only $100-$200 a month, I’m super young so I am still saving some even though I have some student loan debt left)

My problem that I am having is for the first time, I’m tired of driving the same damn car.

t3_bt1ibg,BS2 and Im jealous of people who use debt,"My situation:

Started BS 2 in Feb of 2019

104K income.

Had 35K in debt, down to about 18K (car).  I had used my yearly bonus and savings to jump start this.

Currently paying about 3k a month towards debt.  So Ill be done in about 6 months give or take, my plan is Dec 1 by the latest.

My  wife is stay at home with the kids.    I am one of the the highest paid on my team of 20.

Most of them on my team have 2 incomes, have one or 2  40K vehicles (leased), and live in houses 30-40% more expensive then mine.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

They go out to eat at places that are 6 to 12 dollars several times a week.  I let everyone know what I am doing.  Interestingly, my gas budget of $150 was used up this month, and I told them I didnt have any gas money, let alone money to go eat out LOL.  My budget runs 25th to 24th as I aligned it with paydays.    So gas this month was spot on.

A guy that sits next me has a $700 phone, and a pays nearly $150 a month for his family's phone service.  He has a $400 smart watch.

&amp;#x200B;

I get $200 a month for ""entertainment/Other"" which are things like shoes, or maybe I need an SDcard or something like that.  I told him I wanted to get a video card for my computer so my girls can play fortnight, and all he had to offer me was $300+ cards lol.  I did fine one that is under $100 that will work but give it will wipe out half my budget for this stuff I wont do it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This sucks.  I know once Dec hits, I can start my 401K again  and Ill be building up my nest egg.  By march Ill have about $2200 a month extra if I stick with my current budget.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason Im still jealous.  With my 6-7 months savings, and no debt (other then house) will I get peace of mind?

PS.

Its interesting,  I can squeeze about $2200 a month out of my income.  To save for a 45K car to pay cash will take me like 2 years.

t3_bsy3t9,Health Savings Account on BS2?,"I am enrolled in a HDHP through my employer. Our deductible is $2,000 and the OOP max for the year is $4,000. I met my deductible already for 2019 because of an ER trip that was definitely warranted (an ambulance had to come pick me up and take me there so it was definitely not something where I could have subbed urgent care or asked my primary care doc to squeeze me in the same day) &amp; I'm at a little over $2,000 of the $4,000 OOP max spent so far. I have $1,900 in my HSA but there are still a lot of medical bills that have yet to come that I will be paying out of that, and some pending follow up appointments I need to go to as well that will be billed toward the $4,000 OOP max.

Once I get back on BS2 at the end of June or in early July, I wanted to know what the appropriate amount would be to keep contributing to the HSA? Right now I am putting in $40 per paycheck (so $80 per month since I am paid twice a month) and then my employer puts in $500 a year as well, divided up into $125 per quarter. However, I will want to look at rebuilding what I have in the HSA after I pay out what is currently in it as all the bills come in. My current income/expenses will still allow me to have a $500+ debt snowball once I am back to BS2, even when contributing $40 per check to the HSA. I may want to increase my contribution a little (maybe to like $60 per paycheck instead of $40) to replenish it in case anything else happens.

I do not want to switch to the other plan option we have, which is a PPO with a lower deductible and co-pays. It has been wonderful to not worry about the pending medical bills I have because of the HSA. For the couple bills I have gotten already, I had no stress because I just went online and paid with the HSA debit card because the money was there. I like the tax benefits of having an HSA and I basically look at it like a sinking fund so that I don't have to touch the regular BS1 emergency fund for medical stuff. I know that I could do an FSA for a PPO, but I don't like the ""use it or lose it"" aspect. An HSA is definitely mine forever, so if I estimate incorrectly with how much to contribute, at least the money is always mine and can be used in future years and can be invested as well so that it grows.

What does Dave say about having an HSA in BS2? I know he doesn't want you to contribute to 401(k) in BS2, but this is a bit different and gives me a lot of peace of mind. I look at it as more of a sinking fund than an investment currently and you can't beat how it's triple tax free for contribution, withdrawals (for health expenses) and investment growth.",0

t3_bsbg8b,"Found Dave 6 months ago, and today everything changed!","Today something wonderful happened and I needed to share! Using a throwaway because of family and coworkers.

&amp;#x200B;

I only found out about Dave Ramsey's baby steps 6 months ago, but I've been budgeting tightly my whole life out of necessity/poverty.  I was stuck in that endless cycle of Pay off credit card --&gt; Have an emergency and use credit card --&gt; Pay off credit card, ad infinitum.  Since graduating college 10 years ago, I've been working minimum wage retail jobs, unable to save any money.

&amp;#x200B;

Four years ago, I started a job I truly love, with the highest salary I'd ever had: $33,000 (I had negotiated up from $31,000). I knew I was never going to make a decent living at a tiny, understaffed non-profit, and would be working 60+ hour weeks without overtime, but it felt worth it because it was such meaningful work. And it was still so much more money than I'd ever had! With a promotion, I was bumped up to $35,000, and then again to $39,000. I kept working my butt off for this job I love, knowing the toil was worth it, but not seeing a future with financial stability. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I found Dave, I loved the concepts but was constantly depressed by the posts of people paying down hundreds of thousands in debt in a single year, or having salary levels of $100k and more. That could never be me - with a strict budget it will still take me more than four years to pay down my $15,000 of debt (credit debt + car loan). It felt impossible. After learning about the Baby Steps, I reduced my utilities and cell phone bills, started cooking all my meals at home, and not wasting a single dollar. It only gave me an additional $100 per month to put towards an e-fund. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, my boss sat me down to talk about my work ethic (terrifying) and I walked away with a $26,000 raise. I'll be making $65,000. I was stunned. I still don't believe it. I hadn't asked for it. The raise is more than half of my previous salary. This changes everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I won't do: 

* Change my living budget AT ALL

&amp;#x200B;

What I will do: 

* Cross off Baby Step 1 in a month! 
* Erase all my debt in six months. 
* Finally move forward with my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am so overwhelmingly grateful for the hope this has given me. These goals don't seem unattainable anymore. And my skepticism of ever being able to make a living doing a job I love has been erased. Next: the debt. Thank you for reading - I needed to share and celebrate this financial victory!",0

So now the total for everything is over $400. I am BEYOND frustrated. Like I'm happy I can just pay for it, but I feel like I am never going to get there with filling up BS1. I really don't have anything I can sell to speed it up because I've sold stuff, then stuff comes up where I have to touch the emergency fund...I want to have a sinking fund for auto repairs but I can't until I pay off my first thing in BS2...I have a full time job and a side business with freelance clients for ""2nd job""...I'm just exhausted that I am trying to do the right thing and I keep having setbacks.

&amp;#x200B;

i am an 36 year old guy from germany and i am a bit afraid to do the decision i need to do. My net earnings after taxes and pensions are 2400€ a month. My current monthly budget (including rent, insurances, car use, cloth, food etc.) is 1600€ a month i am currently saving 600€ a month. My ""fun"" eg. not necessary expanses like vacations, and so on is 200€ a month. Current savings are: 6 month of expanses + emergency fund + 16000€ in stocks + 8000€ in ""Bausparverträgen"" + retirement plans (90000€).

Now its time for a change. I want to buy a home near were i work. 

What will it do:

I will safe \~\~ 1,5 hours travel time each day, it will be a non rented place; i will not need a car any more 

What i have to do for it:

I will need to sell my stocks + Bausparverträge; I will not touch my retirement plans

I will have to get a loan for it (KWF Kredit) 50000€ for 1,1%pa fixed rate for 10 years

I will have to use my ""6 month of expanses"" to get furniture etc.

After the move i can sell my car to get \~\~ 3 month of expanses back

My current Calculation says my monthly budget increases to 1800€ including the payment of the loan.

So my Question for you is: does my plan sound okay or am i missing something?

t3_bs33xf,WWDD? I will have enough cash to pay off my mortgage.,"My debt is almost completely gone, I have a small amount left on a auto loan, and my mortgage. I have recently come into a windfall and after the sale of a property I should have enough cash to pay off everything and have 0 debt across the board. I am torn between paying off my mortgage at 4.5% and investing the windfall though, which ""should"" generate around 7% year over year. I know I am a little undisciplined when it comes to saving, so I keep thinking just putting this money away now may be a better option then trusting me to increase my saving over time. I am currently investing 7% of my pay into a 401K, with my employer putting 3%, and I also have a pension. I am not sure if I need to increase that much more once I include my pension, but I do plan on at least increasing it by 1% a year to 10%, but I have also considered starting a Roth IRA instead of adding to my 401K as well. If it matters, I am 34.

t3_bs3748,I was a wise student. Now I am a dumb grown-up.,"Newbie here. So, I was following Dave Ramsey since my 2016. Than I stopped watching him before my finals, because I didn\`t have any time. And income, actually. So, after graduating I spent around 800-1000$ on clothes, makeup, going out, groceries. That was my hard-earned money, that was in a saving account. But still, I spent too much I think.

Then last fall I got new job, finally moved from parents, and started to live an aduld life. Without savings. With paycheck-to-paycheck life. 

So I\`m from Russia, and salary here is much lower than in USA, while renting is lower too, but house prices are much higher. So let\`s start.

My paycheck is 600$, I\`m 22 y.o., just graduated. I have 9-6 job, and spent 2 hours in public transport a day. I rent a room with a friend, and with light, water, taxes and internet it costs \~280$. No car, not even planning to get one. No student debt, it\`s very rare in Russia.

Actually, I had another savings \~1200$ in cash. Being a dumb young girl, I spent it when I didn\`t have funds. Every month since january I went on -80$, which is big considering on how much I make. (to make it simple: I make 40000 rub/month after taxes, and every month I spent additional 5000 rub from my savings). 

Yesterday I had to pay my rent. I realized I don\`t have any money to live on. Ok, I have practically a debt. Not a credit card! I just owe myself. Last week I asked my mom to help me, because I was terrifyed. And yesterday I asked again - because I haven\`t got enough to pay rent. I asked her ""maybe I should get a credit card? Maybe this is what will make me responsible? And she said but you were always against debt and even watched this american guy... Something clicked in my brain.

I have 0 in cash, 500$ in rub in savings account, and an actual 1000 in dollars in cash, that I saved looong ago from a trip to California. At least I have one more month to live somewhere. I can\`t move back to my parents, or to change a job. My job sucks beacuse I have to stay on it till november to get a full year in one place for my resume.

I am overwhelmed and scared. And completely lost. I feel guilty, because even last year I was ok with my finances. I was better than most students around me!

Looking for an advice here. For the nearest future, at least those 6 months. How do I get out from this little hole of debt, before it will become bigger?

t3_brwepg,Dave on Real Estate and never paying more than 70%,"So the other day Dave gave his advice to a caller on how to figure out how much is too much to pay for a property.  Dave explained his top value is 70% of the appraised value and then he deducts from that anything for repairs needed to get it livable.  He admits he's willing to go up to 80% for his top end in certain circumstances but tries to keep it closer to 70%.  He also talks about it on the website [here](https://www.daveramsey.com/askdave/investing-and-retirement/real-estate-investing-101).

&amp;#x200B;

So I get it, real estate is hyper local and I don't live in Nashville or Tennessee.  And I really get that all the money you make in real estate is made at the buy (meaning it's all about how little you can pay for it).  But I can't imagine anyone letting go of property for that low ball of an offer.  Back in 2009 when I bought my current house I had multiple sellers tell me to ""go eff yourself"" because I was trying to negotiate from 160k to 155k due to repairs, etc.  And one of the sellers was in a super desperate divorce situation too.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no reason not to believe Dave but based on my personal experience and the experience of close friends and family where I was loosely involved in the negotiation I don't understand how Dave's method here has worked.  I'd almost go so far to call his strategy insulting.  He must make 100 offers for every one that gets accepted.  I guess with a strategy like that you're basically a predator going after divorce and death sales where people are just so desperate to get rid of the property?  I don't get it.

t3_bsaea3,I still don't understand Dave's argument against saving for a home down payment inside a Roth IRA. I've heard his talk on it and I don't agree.,"Ok so I'm in BS 4 at the moment. I'm single, no kids and about to turn 30. I don't make a lot of money but my expenses are also pretty low so I am able to save a pretty significant amount on my retirement (percentage wise). I don't know if I will ever buy a house since I live in a very expensive market. The cheapest starter home is $400K. 

My thought process is why not just save as much as I can into Roth IRA and Roth 401K above my emergency fund?  Then if I ever have a chance to buy a house (maybe I get a job somewhere else or get married), I'll have some money there that's been growing. If I never end up buying a house, then no big deal, I'll have a larger amount in my retirement. 

I also don't want to have another savings account for a house downpayment when I'm not even sure I want to be a home owner. It seems like a waste to keep money just in a savings account not doing anything for no goal or aim.",0
t3_brxql8,What does Dave say regarding child care?,"Hey y’all! I’ve only been listening for a few months, and haven’t heard this addressed yet. Husband and I will be out of BS2 in a couple of months, and have BS3 completed within 6 months. 115k total house hold income, rent will is &lt;25% of take home pay, husband has a forced contribution of 6%, otherwise we plan to do BS 3b and save for a house within 3 years (3 years is due to my job being a training position and under a 3 yr contract - we’re renting until we move after that). 

BUT. We have two kiddos (2yo and 9mo), and we pay $3000/mo for childcare. It’s important for us to have them in a daycare that doesn’t consider ketchup a vegetable (and the like), but this is putting a big ole slowdown in our baby steps/future savings.

t3_brrsfq,I’m at my wits end. What am I doing wrong?,"Sorry if this seems slightly out of place. I posted this on r/advice and was told this sub might be a better place to relent my issues as a lot of them are financial related. 

I work two jobs just to make ends meet. And even then I don’t have a lot of spare money. I just started the second job so that I might be able to move out of my friends old bedroom (I’m living with his mom rent free since five months ago my fiancé dumped me and I had to move cities), but now as if this morning my truck is basically unusable as the check engine light came on and googling the symptoms shows it may be a transmission problem or my motor all together is shot. I don’t have hardly any savings, all that I do have is a small amount I got in a tax return that I JUST got this morning and was hoping to use it to start a savings and pay off some debts. I’m in no position to be able to buy a new car, ubering to work and back would cost me more then I make in a day. I spend all my free time applying to jobs I’m over qualified for on Indeed and Glassdoor but to no response. My phone is also breaking down and also needs to be replaced. I now am going to have rely on someone to drive me to work each day/shift (most days I work both jobs). I’m at my wits end. I feel numb, because this shit-uation was all of 2018 for me and 2019 was supposed to be better. I’ve contemplated suicide but I’m a fighter, I’m on anti depressants, I have good people around me but JESUS CHRIST can I catch a fucking break already? It’s like life wants me to hang myself. I can’t get anywhere, I can’t progress, all I want to is to be self sufficient but no matter how hard I try, how thin I stretch myself, how many avenues and directions I go, I’m met with wall after wall after wall. Donald trump could get hard on hearing about these fucking walls. 

I’m honestly at a lost on what to do. I’ve been trying so hard to be self sufficient and I’m working so hard. It feels like life is pushing my head just beneath the surface of water and just as I get close enough to breath or come up for air, I’m pushed back down. What am I doing wrong?

Edit: fixed some grammar and spelling that you miss when ranting feverishly on the internet.

Edit 2: I posted this as a response but I’ll put here as well since most of y’alls question are basically about this info 

“I work in retail and as a server. Both jobs are experiencing slow seasons so it’s hard to get a perfect 40 hours and if I could work more I would. I’ve been averaging at about35-37 hours a week, about half and half between the two jobs. I get paid ten an hour in retail, serving it depends on the day, weather, and time of year. I used to on average make about 17 an hour or more, but lately it’s more like 10-12 an hour range with it being slow. I don’t have any living expenses yet, but when I do move, which I’m trying for half way through June, I’ll pay about 500-600(at most, trying to avoid 600) a month, and that includes utilities and other expenses. Monthly I pay only 90 a month (I got lucky to not have too much student debt). I have a credit card that is over 800 dollars used on it which is killing my credit. I (try to) pay about 50$ or more per month to get it down. It used to be 1000 so I’m making head way. I also pay 35 a month for a credit card I actively use in a effort to build good credit. I have one duragatory mark on my credit (I kinda got pressured into a pet insurance I couldn’t keep up with when I got my first dog three years ago). 

As of this morning I did receive my tax return. It’s about 700 and it’s the only real money I have currently. I wanted to use it to get rid of the mark, start a savings, and maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaybe do a small, cheap something for myself. But with my truck there’s a fair chance that’s where that’ll go, if it’s even a fix I can afford. My truck is 2003 and trying to die on me so within the next year my goals financially are to get credit debt paid off, pay rent and have my own place shared with roommates, and maybe, hopefully, please god, have a new(er) car that I either own or am making payments on.”

I live on the outskirts of a city known for its art. I have a lot skills in various types of art, a degree in one of those fields. It’s just very hard to get a job and a good paying job at that, in the art scene. I knew what I was getting myself into when I chose my career path, but all the same I do have notable other skills non art related. I have over four years of customer service experience and what not. I’m trying to use that as an advantage for these jobs I’m applying for. But like I said I haven’t had much luck. I’ve had my resume looked over, proofed, critiqued. I’m not above getting more opinions but I really don’t think (emphasis on think) a bad resume is my problem.  I have multiple for various art roles and non art jobs. 

As far those of you looking through my post history and making mentions on some things you’ve seen; pot use has been full stopped. Obviously couldn’t afford it and it really wasn’t helping anymore. As for gaming, I have pc I built a year ago with some graduation money. If I had known I’d be here in a year I definitely wouldn’t have spent it that way, but here I am, not able to see he future.

t3_brtroh,"keep renters insurance, or cancel?","hey guys, long story short my wife, and I are really doing our very best to become financially responsible. Baby step 1 is complete, and we are full force into baby step 2. We've been going over some bills, and outgo to see what items are smart to cut out. Our renters insurance costs about \~$900 for the year. Should we keep this insurance policy in place, or cancel it out until our debt is paid off? The renewal is coming up, and we pay the full year in advance. So guys, do we pay the $900 and keep the policy going, or cancel it out? Any advice?",0
t3_brun7b,Pension Rollover question,"Hey DR Peeps. Question for anyone who has rolled over a pension to a traditional IRA. I just got off the phone with Fidelity to set this up and the customer service rep explained that there would be 2 checks distributed to me: 1) money from my former employer, plus interested earned on it, plus interest earned on my contributions which will go directly into my traditional IRA account and 2) a live check that would be paid to me for my direct contributions only.

&amp;#x200B;

The second check caught me off guard. I was told it is after tax money so in theory there's no taxes to be paid on it. However, I'm under age 59 1/2, so my questions are:

1. Will I get an early withdrawal penalty?
2. What are my options with this money? Can I redeposit it right into my traditional IRA?  Or should I /can I roll it into a Roth IRA?
3. Any other implications I'm not thinking of?

I'm in Baby Step 2, so I just want to know what to expect in case I need to pay anything. The rep couldn't tell me how much the check was going to be for until I submit the paperwork and they run the final calculations. He said it would be for a small amount, but honestly, I can't remember how much I directly contributed to this pension since it was over a decade ago, and it has since been closed by my former employer. So I have no way to look and see what my contributions were once upon a time. I just see the total amount sitting there today.

The reason I wanted to do this was because Dave recommends rolling over pensions and  401ks/403bs generally plus I like the idea that the money would now go to my heirs in the event of my death.

Any help would be appreciated. Things like pensions and IRA's are not my wheelhouse so to speak so please feel free to  pretend you're talking to a kindergartener with any of your answers :)

Thanks in advance!",0
t3_brnhiu,Sit or run?,I purchased a completely outdated and run down hud home that required 3 years owner occupant. I owe 57k on a 4.25% 30 year fixxed loan and have 35k on a 5.25% variable heloc at a local credit union mainly from completion of renovations this house needed. The house is basically ready to sell and will move in my market immediately as was my intentions from the start. Thing is as I come to the finish line I'm getting a little attached to the property and the location it offers. This is my only debt and I can't decide if I should take my money and run to save while renting debt free or gazelle the heloc. I make 50k a year right now and in 12 months will be at 60k. My house values a little over 130k. I appreciate any advice and thank you in advance.,0
t3_brda1a,Wife and I are tired of being Broke,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am taking the time to create this post because goals that are written down are more likely to be accomplished. About 2 weeks ago I listened to the total money makeover. My wife and I have decided to get on board and finally start building wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we make about 96k of taxable income. We make an additional 36k that is non-taxable money and then on top of that my wife also does real estate. We currently have 3 homes all on borrowed money and we make a small ""profit"" on the two we rent. This is more money than either of us ever thought we would make. On top of that if we buckle down and pay our debt off we are talking of having upwards of 5-6k a month of free cash flow to invest, spend, and give.

&amp;#x200B;

We have listed our debts and have finally realized how much debt we actually have. It is overwhelming now that we see the number. I have listed those debts below and will refer back to them as we pay them off.

&amp;#x200B;

CC- 220 (Paid)

Tax Debt- 4100 (Paid)

Diff CC- 4200- $2200

1st Vehicle- 5200 (Paid)

Repair loan for one property- 9100

2nd vehicle- 18,000

3rd Vehicle- 18,000

Student Loan- 10,000

Student Loan- 55,000

1st Rental- 125,000

2nd Rental- 236,000

Our house- 346,000

Total $830,600

&amp;#x200B;

That number is outrageous to me and it makes me panic! We are expecting our second child and want to become financially secure in the next 18 months. When I speak of the debt being paid off I am excluding the houses, for now.  I have taken the Gazelle intense outlook to pay down this debt. I have worked 80 hours of OT so far this month and will be working another 40. It has been difficult taking the time away from my family. My wife has been very supportive and has worked hard. She works and also takes care of our son while I have been doing this OT, all why being 8 months pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the month we will be in a position to pay off our Tax Debt, 1st Vehicle, and half of the 1st Credit card. The OT plus my wife selling a property this month is what has allowed this. This amount of cash flow is not a normal thing for us. However, it is really getting our snow ball rolling and rolling quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

We do have a lot of risk so we have doubled the emergency fund to start. Now that we have paid half the original Tax debt amount last month we have realized how much we could honestly pay off, if we focus. We have some substantial equity in our 3 homes since the housing market has sky rocketed in our city since 2013. We have no interest in selling any of our homes but I may be selling my truck to free up even more money. The equity in our homes is what has kept us from completely panicking with our finances.

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely focused on paying off our debt and want to take on another 100 hours of OT next month. My wife is some what supportive of this, but not fully. I am torn because that would be another few thousand in excess income to pay more debt. At the same time I feel guilty because I am leaving her responsible for our son regularly. I think I may slow down on work since our 2nd child will be here in about a month. I will update this post as we cross items off our list.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading.

Update #1
I’ve read all the comments and some people are saying sell it all some say sell this or that. We do not want to sell our houses. I thought about it and honestly we are not big fans of our second rental. It is very true that just selling that house will eliminate almost all of our debt. 

My tenants in that rental were interested in buying the house at one point. I decided to reach out to them and ask if they would like to purchase the home. Well the decision has been made for us. They are military and are moving in July. So we will be selling that house come July. I’ll be selling my truck in about a month. 

I think this will put us in a very good position. If it all works out all we will be left with is paying off the remainder of one vehicle and the larger student loan. We will of course have the 2 houses once the debt is paid and I am ok with that. I’ll update again once the 1st vehicle and tax debt are paid next week.

Update #2
We paid off our tax debt yesterday. We also paid our 1st car off this morning. Additionally, we paid 2k off of our lowest credit card. I would say this is a successfully start to our journey. A little extra work led to some big pay offs.",0
t3_brf3sq,Everything* I own is for sale.,"^(\*There is one exception, but it is something that I promised family that I would pass down and never sell.)

I have a motto. Everything I have is for sell. Some things may cost way more than it is worth, but everything has a number. I'm currently living this motto.

Here is little background. My wife and I are in BS2. We have been slowly snowballing our debt. We live in one of the richest (expensive) counties in the state. The schools are amazing, but the prices here are sky high. Because of this, the snowballing is pretty slow. But I understand, ""we don't get a pass on math"". I work from home and my wife stays at home and is currently over 8 months pregnant with our second child.

About a month ago, we felt led to sell our house and move back closer to home. I can work anywhere there is internet. The cost of living is so much cheaper back home, land is $1,500 - $2,000 an acre vs $15,000+ here. Property taxes are much better as well. We put our house on the market and were under contract in 6 days. We are due to close in 2 months and move with a toddler and a newborn (wish us luck).

After doing some math, we will be out of BS2 in 8-10 months instead of closer to 2-3 years. BS3a should take us 4-5 months. BS3b will probably take 2 years, because we will be putting more than 20% down to make a 15 year mortgage make sense for the size house we will be looking at. We will either have 6 figures saved for a down payment, or a comfortable mortgage on our forever home\*\* that we can pay off early. If we stayed here we would be house poor for the next 30 years. Either way, we will be light-years ahead of where we would be if we stayed.

I just wanted to post this here to give people encouragement. Don't be afraid to be weird and sell everything. You can always buy things later.

t3_brepez,BS2 What has Dave said about celebrating victories in Baby step 2,"I have googled this question and not found anything from Dave Ramsey on celebrating paying off debts.

I am about to finish paying off my last credit card (not last debt) and it looks like I will have about $60 in my budget this paycheck that I could roll towards the next debt, but I kind of want to use to reward my wife for her participation in doing the baby steps.  She is not wanting to be as intense as I do, but is accepting it, and participating in it.  I feel like if I could make paying off this debt an event and make it something fun that it might help motivate her to continue more happily, and be more motivated.  

Conversely, am I just using paying off this debt as justification to waste $60 that could go towards putting us $60 closer to being debt free?

Even if I do spend the money on a fun outing for the family, Its not like I can do it on every single debt I pay off, but this seems like a milestone.  future milestones would be like having both vehicles paid off, and having student loans paid off (which would be the conclusion of baby step 2)

I would appreciate thoughts and opinions.",0

I am on baby step 2 with 30k left in Student Loans. I have currently paid off 8K in 9 months and I want to stay gazelle intense. My largest roadblock currently is an unreliable car.
 
My car is a 2002 Camry with 161k miles and will not pass emissions in the state of MA. My inspection sticker expires this month. To pass inspection, the repair on the exhaust will be more than the car is worth. To extend my time with this paid-for car, I will get the car inspected next week and drive on a reject sticker for a month. This will allow to drive until the end of June.  After that I will be forced to make a decision.
 
I refuse to go into debt to buy a car so I wanted to ask for advice
 
Should I stop my baby steps, pay minimum payments and stockpile cash for a 3-5k Car? Or are there any other option that I am not thinking of?
 
I am open to do working an extra job like Lyft/Uber but my current car does not qualify. If looking for a different car, I would get one that does qualify for a ride share service.

We have the 2 options that I can think of. Which is the best for us?

Option 1: Sell home and use some of the money to pay off the $36,000 and put the rest as a small down payment for a house which should bring my mortgage down to around $1100 or worse case $1250. \*Please note that moving to another house would probably be located about an hour away from where my wife works considering houses and condos are way out of our budget near our area. Also renting is too expensive where we live.

Option 2: Refinance the home and do a cash out on it for the $36,000 to pay off the debt. However this will increase my monthly mortgage to estimated $1576. This only leave us with $80.82 at the end after all bills have been paid.

What should we do if you are in my situation?

He is a workhorse, he is my hero when it comes to work and intelligence (credit aside, please be nice.) To keep his, and my Mother's house, he sold it to a gentleman who understood his situation, and helped them as much as he could.

My father wants me to apply for a 250k (we are putting the rest of the money down) loan to buy the house and keep it in the family. Why? I have credit scores in the high 800's, but zero debt in my life. The agreement? He will pay the payment, and if the worst happens (he is in great health, but I am not stupid) I will own the house via an irrevocable trust in the event of his death. Details: He is an attorney that makes plenty of money to pay these payments. I have loaned him money many times in the past with ZERO problems. I know all is well as long as he is alive.

t3_bqc4gu,[BS2] I'm a bit confused about budgets with no 'due date' (i.e: groceries),"I get paid twice a week. We have bills with due dates throughout the month, plus a few budgets that don't have 'due dates' like Groceries, Miscellaneous, Car Gas, etc. How do we ensure that we're not going to accidentally overdraft/zero out our bank account before the next paycheck comes out, or bill is due? I really hope that makes sense.

t3_bq41kf,Success Saturday!,"Central to Dave’s program is the notion that [personal finance is 80% behavior](https://www.daveramsey.com/askdave/budgeting/whats-the-reason-for-the-debt-snowball). The debt snowball builds a series of small wins and keeps the finish line for the next goal in sight. Debt-free screams on the radio show are a big reward for people who have knocked out all their consumer debt and are motivating to listeners who are either working through the baby steps or are becoming sick and tired of being sick and tired. [Financial Peace University](https://www.daveramsey.com/fpu/) provides the technical details of personal finance, but more importantly FPU builds accountability and provides a place to cheer each other on the way to becoming debt-free.

* … decide to cut up your credit cards and have photo or video evidence to prove it?
* … finally sit down with your spouse to work out the budget?
* … complete your $1,000 emergency fund?
* … give up your daily Starbucks or other treat to increase your gazelle intensity?
* … increase your retirement contribution?
* … graduate to the next baby step?
* … have a friend admonish you with great concern that you just don’t want to give up the mortgage interest deduction?

I was wondering how you guys would recommend to put the emergency fund? 
Do you guys draw it out as cash and keep somewhere safe, make a new current account and just leave it in that, or make some kinda savings account with access if needed?

The only outstanding debt I’ve got is a 0% finance loan for an expensive new bed (wife has a knackered back and this sorted it), nothing else except that and the overdrafts which are now gone.

Do you guys think after the bed loan has gone, it’s worth paying off the device plans from mine and my wife’s phone contract? That’ll bring the monthly phone payments down from like £67 for both to £18 or so",0

I have recently won the diversity visa lottery and was wondering if it makes financial sense for me to move to the USA.
I am a Turkish Cypriot, currently living in Turkey and working as a ship agent.
Although my salary (appx. 1200 USD/month) will sound very low to Americans, it allows me to have a one bedroom apartment in a central district in Istanbul, probably start saving around around 150USD/month after bs2 and as my mother now lives by the beach with her husband she left her car to me. With these standards I have, I basically can afford a pretty comfortable almost debt free life.

I'm only 26 and I can hopefully expect these figures to go up in the future.

If I decide to move to the USA I'll only choose to live in the Boston-Washington DC or NYC area. I want to be able to be in Turkey without connecting flights and California doesn't really inspire me.

t3_bpjjto,Personal Connection/Resume/Cover Letter help for RamseySolutions.,"I was introduced to Dave Ramsey over ten years ago in high school. I soaked up everything I could and have followed his principles ever since. Today, I am debt free and on my way to financial independence (Currently on Baby Steps 4-7). Since high school it has been a dream of mine to work for his company. I have read ""Quitter,"" ""Monk and the Merchant, and ""Millionaire Next Door."" I plan to eventually read all the books on their recommended list. ""The Proximity Principle"" is next on my list!


I am tailoring my resume specifically for RamseySolutions following Ken Coleman's resume [guide](https://cdn.ramseysolutions.net/media/b2c/personalities/ken/resources/ken-coleman-resume-guide.pdf?_ga=2.257692107.155971193.1558046184-1329014531.1557173033). In it Coleman recommends adding someone who is already a part of the company into your references. The only connection I have that I am aware of is that a few years ago someone from my church (Kindred Community Church, Anaheim Hills, CA) had applied and now works at RamseySolutions. Obviously, this is quite a vague and impersonal connection, not suitable for a resume.


Coleman says, ""You don’t need a direct connection to establish credibility or leverage relationship capital. Many times, you may not know someone personally—but don’t let that limit you. If a current employee recommends you for an interview based solely on a recommendation from a close friend or family member, it can still move you to the top of the list."" It might be a stretch but I was hoping someone here could guide me on how to make a connection properly and professionally. 


Please look at my [Draft Resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4fisrmz0a73dcz2/Resume%20to%20Send.pdf?dl=0) and my [Draft Cover Letter](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9rkoccls9fksgj1/IT%20Cover%20Letter%20%28Ramsey%20Solutions%29.pdf?dl=0) The positions I am targeting are [IT Support Technician](https://www.daveramsey.com/careers/opportunities?category=Technology&amp;p=job%2Fo1w29fws) and [Administrative Assistant, Video Team](https://www.daveramsey.com/careers/opportunities?category=Technology&amp;p=job%2FoWpX9fwb). Which do you think I am qualified for, if any, why or why not. I aim to make IT a life long career and am hoping RamseySolutions gives me that opportunity. 


Any information will be greatly appreciated! Remember to live like no one else so later we can live like no one else!

t3_bovgrt,First Student Loan Paid Off Today,"Started listening to Dave’s show about three months ago. I’ve got a ways to go, but the progress is undeniable. 

Since that time, I’ve tackled BS1, listed my debts from smallest to largest, cut back unnecessary spending, and actually created a budget. 

I had been knocking out smaller debts. However, today, I was balancing my budget and realized there was a sizable amount left after minimum payments this month. I looked at my debt snowball sheet and the next lowest item on the list was a $2k student loan that was dispersed back in 2005. I had been paying the monthly minimum ($77) for nearly a decade (after deferments). 

All of a sudden, I got really nervous. I didn’t want to part with $2k on a random Tuesday afternoon. I didn’t want to see my balance, which is healthier than its ever been, take a hit. In addition, this $77 monthly payment has been part of my life for a long time, kind of like a toxic relationship one sticks with because they’re just used to it.

I called a friend of mine from graduate school. The only one I know who has paid off all his student loans. Also a student of the baby steps. He encouraged me to knock it out, which is precisely what I did. 

It feels good. As mentioned, I’ve got a ways to go. There is still a tremendous amount of weight. However, marking items on my snowball spreadsheet as paid is gaining momentum. I don’t feel light yet, but lighter than yesterday.

t3_bp5asq,Preparing for a Cross-Country Move when you don't know the location yet?,"*Cross-posted with* r/personalfinance

**TL;DR:** My question is basically what's in the title. Cross-country move in 15 months. Won't know the location until 4 months ahead of time. Hoping for more specific advice than just ""pile up cash.""  

Some details that might matter: 

Household: Me (22), spouse (24), dog (7). We currently have my sister (18) and her dog (8) living with us, but sis and her dog will most likely not move with us.  

We are on Baby Step 2, more Dave-ish than Gazelle intense, and paused because I know we need to save up to cash flow this. 

Our only debt is my student loans from my B.A. ($12k left) which are not collecting interest and we have no actual payments on it since I'm still in school. We've been Snowballing them already, hoping to have them paid off before they have a chance to build up interest. 

Household income was $42k last year, my income is incredibly low as I am a Teaching Assistant with a small stipend, but it also comes with a Tuition Waiver that pays 95% of my educational expenses.

I'm currently working on my M.A. and have just officially settled on applying out to Ph.D. programs this fall.  That means sending out applications to roughly a dozen universities all across the U.S., and potentially Canada, this December and then holding my breath until March-April when I find out where I've been accepted. It will not be until mid-April that we know for sure where we will need to move by August. 

I'm not applying to any programs in our current state or neighboring states, so this will definitely be a cross-country level move unless I don't get accepted at all.

We are currently renting and plan to rent in the new location. Our current yearly lease was just extended until 6/30/2020, I will probably ask our management company if they can extend us month-to-month once we're closer and have a real game plan, no idea how likely they are to work with us. 

Assuming no major increases in income or expenses, my conservative prediction is that we can have at least $6k saved up by next May, on top of our regular $2k emergency fund, for moving + transition between jobs.

Any advice on what we can do now to be ready, or what we should prioritize once we know the location, is welcome.",0

When Dave made a big deal about Dollar Car rental accepting debt cards I signed up with them for an express account a few months ago.  Just wanted to warn anyone else that might have, there's an option to set up your preferences for extra insurance which will automatically be used in any rentals you order.  Apparently I selected that at some point, but when you pre-pay for a rental online it will not add the cost of the insurance to the total it shows.  We got hit with approx $360 extra charges because of this and we were in such a hurry at the time(~2 year old that misses nap time!) I erroneously assumed it was a debt card hold charge and the money would be credited back.  When we got back from vacation I noticed the issue, can't really blame them for not being willing to refund the money but I thought I would warn anyone else that might have signed up.

t3_bokqd7,Murphy always shows up eventually,"Just a couple weeks after making it out of BS3 and beginning to save up for a nicer, newer car, Murphy came around. 

Our two dogs got out of their crate and into some trail mix while we were out to dinner. The trail mix had raisins in it (one of the most toxic things a dog can ingest) and so we began our midnight run to the emergency vet. For anyone who doesn’t know: literally a single raisin could kill a Great Dane, but it’s impossible to know your dog’s sensitivity to grapes/ raisins until they’re either fine or in acute kidney failure. There’s essentially no middle ground. (Fun).

The vet quoted us $5,400 to treat both dogs, (it ended up being far less) which we would have been able to do because of Dave Ramsey. Before this program, idk what we would have done. We probably would have gone into crazy debt because let’s be honest, I’d have given my own kidney to my dog if I were able to. 

I’ve always joked to friends and family that we’re doing this “crazy Dave Ramsey thing” to create a better life for our dogs, and I guess the universe was listening.

t3_bon75b,Feel stuck in job due to finances...,"TL;DR I fell into a career that wasn’t my intention for life, and now I’m stuck because I have too many financial obligations. 


I love Dave Ramsey because he gives such great life advice during his calls and rants. I’m sitting in front of my TV right now watching his show on YouTube. I’m desperate for some guidance, and KNOW that I’m battling some serious depression right now.

I’m 38, moved to L.A. because I thought I wanted to be a writer for children’s TV. I worked at the Jim Henson company in development, and did some other production work. However, my connections never led to much of anything, and I mostly got rejection. There was also something deep down that really didn’t like the business side of the industry - you have to pander and work on a lot of crappy stuff that you pretend to like. I also suck at networking and could never seem to get the hang of that. 

So, I moved on, but not without some disappointment that things didn’t turn out the way I wanted. Part of me is still hanging onto it, but I feel like my window of opportunity has probably passed...I haven’t kept in touch with anyone in the industry. 

To make money, I became a full time dog walker, and really enjoyed it - I love animals. But the downside was putting 100+ miles on my car every day and there is a cap on how much money you can make. As I get older, I also find my energy isn’t what it was a few years ago. I still have three dog walking clients as a side gig because I have a really good relationship with them.

One of my clients hired me to be her assistant in a small business. At first I was doing basic admin stuff, but then they found out I could do graphic design and tech/web stuff (took a year of graphic design in college and used to work for Apple). My responsibilities grew and they hired me full time several months ago. I do all their web, graphics...anything tech related. I guess you could say I’m like the CTO of the company, but it’s a young company. 

The thing is, I never envisioned myself in a tech job, even though I have years of experience in the field. I’ve always been more of a creative person and envisioned myself working in entertainment - because I have years of experience doing that also. I’m really good at writing and have had numerous people tell me that’s what I should be doing. 

Bottom line is that I’m very unhappy in life. I struggle to get out of bed and get anything done (I work remotely from home), and I just mope around all day. There are many things I want to learn, but I can’t break out of this depressed feeling to do them. I feel like I’m on the wrong track in life. My tech job is very generous and they leave me alone to do the work for the most part, but in my heart it’s not what I want to do. 

Problem is my monthly expenses are $4,000 here in L.A., they pay for my health insurance, and if I left the job, I’d be screwed financially. I just can’t do it. I guess I could stick with it for a short period and try to figure out something else - but I don’t know what to do. I need some hope and something to look forward to again, because I literally just feel like sitting down and crying most days. It’s like I’m paralyzed and can’t even make myself do basic stuff.

t3_bod4q5,Should I sell my house?,"I'm a 29 year old single male, and I'm currently in BS2. I have about 9k left on a student loan that should be paid off by the end of the summer. About 18 months ago, I bought a home that I couldn't afford. I took in a roommate because of the mess I was in. My financial situation has improved and I earn 15k more a year now than I did when I bought the place. However, the home is on a 30 year-fixed and it exceeds 1/4 of my take home pay. The market I am in is still strong, particularly at the 250k range which is approximately what the home is worth. If I sold it tomorrow I would likely break even (taking into account the rent I've collected). Should I sell? I like the home but the payment is a stretch without the rental income.

&amp;#x200B;

Income: $4200/mo take-home

Mortgage/Taxes/Insurance: $1250/mo

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your feedback, I really appreciate it! 

Add'l Info: Roommate is still here, they give me 650/mo. I do not want to live with a roommate forever but this is my current situation. The home is a 1000 SF, 3bd rowhome, so it is rather large for just one person. Lastly, it is an older home and besides the cosmetic upgrades I made when I bought it (which got me into 15k of person loan debt, leading me to DR) the maintenance is stacking up. I recently had to get a new roof (3k) and need to have some exterior masonry work done soon (2k). Additionally, the systems are older so I know that I'll need a new furnace in the next 2-3 years (5-7k) and a new water heater in the next 12 months (1.2k-1.5k). My thought it that if I sell and can get an apartment for 1100/mo, I can save for the next 3-4 years and  purchase something when I can truly afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

One bedrooms in my area generally go for 1100-1500 depending on the neighborhood. I am currently spending 250/mo on utilities which would certainly go down if I moved into a 1bd apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

One more item to note, maybe it makes a difference and maybe it doesn't. I live in an urban area in the northeast, where most of my family lives. My chosen career tends to be most present in urban areas, so I would need to move to another urban area if I chose to move. I live in one of more affordable cities so it financially and personally makes sense to stay here.",0

t3_boa7hc,Constantly torn as to what to do- Single mom trying to get ahead financially. Any advice?,"So I'll try to make this short. I listen to Dave every day and I want so badly to call in but with my work schedule it's nearly impossible. Anyway, I'm a divorced mom of 3 (19, 16 &amp; 13). I live in a high cost of living area, have been here all my life. It's all I know and it's all my kids know. My 19 year old still lives at home and is going to the nearby community college. I own my home, however I am house poor as Dave would say. 

&amp;#x200B;

The dilemma I have is this: If i sell my house to get out from that monster payment, in order to stay in this area, rent would be the same, if not more than what I'm paying for my house. I look almost every day to see what rent costs in our area. It just wouldn't make sense to sell, unless I moved. And I'd have to move FAR for it to make a difference. Due to my kids ages, I don't want to just uproot them. My middle child is a junior in high school and my youngest is in middle school. A move would be very hard on them. I am able to make ends meet but I can't get ahead. I have about $48k in student loans and a credit card with $875. I will be able to pay the credit card off probably in the next 6 months but the student loans are rough. I make payments and the balance doesn't budge. My thought is to stick it out for 5 more years until my youngest graduates high school and then reassess my situation. Possibly sell at that point and move to a less expensive area. I have quite a bit of equity that would probably allow me to buy a house outright in another state. I'm curious what other's thoughts are on my situation. Would you stick it out or would you uproot your kids even though it would very difficult. They may even refuse to go and choose to stay with their dad which would kill me. I don't think I could move away from my children. I don't want to play victim, but I truly do feel stuck. At least for the next 5 years. Thanks for reading if you made it this far!",0
t3_bo6gjz,Advice on unmotivated SO?,"Hey guys!
So I started Dave Ramsey’s baby steps the beginning of April (BS2) and have paid $6000 off in debt so far. I was able to pay off my car completely and what we have left is my husbands car (13k) and husbands student loans (50k). I am a nurse so I have been working a ton of overtime since April and I am wore out. I am taking a break from so much OT now to prevent getting burnt out. My husband is a teacher and has summers off so I began discussing with him about looking for a part time job over the summer to help expedite paying off his car. He is completely unwilling to get any kind of part time job. He said he considers his summer his “time off” and part of me is a little pissed because (I know it’s OUR debt) but really it’s his debt and I feel like I’m overworking myself and putting all the effort into paying off his debt. Honestly it’s making me want to stop working so hard. Any advice on ways to help motivate him? Or is anyone else in a similar situation?",0

I started downloading Dave Ramsey’s podcast recently and love it, have used some of his stuff and shared articles to my clients. 


In my area it’s a really tough market to be selling, there’s a lot of inventory on the market and if homes aren’t marketed or priced properly they will be sitting for awhile. My company specifically has had some units sitting for over a year.  It on the flip side we have dropped our prices quite a bit. 

I have a client who wants to sell his acreage and move into the city into a maintenance free townhome. He’s worried about taking a hit and if he does he doesn’t want to sell it. Maybe sit on it for a year and hope the market is going to turn around. But then in the flip side if it turns around for him to make more money my fear is to buy it’s going to turn around and cost him the same on other end.  The place he’s selling and buying are in the same region.

My wife and I have been to FPU twice, worked at the program for close to 6 years to varying degrees of failure, and are still here, looking at getting our BS1 fund saved for probably the 4th time.  Each time we start, she gives all the right answers, then goes and does what she wants.  When I get angry, she doesn't respond.  When I""m nice, I get even more blank stares and non-convo.  I'm the sole breadwinner and there have been several times that I've taken over the finances completely, until at some point, she begins to whine or complain enough that I cave.  We have a 2 year old now, so it gets even worse financially now because she springboards a ""he should be able to...or he needs..."".  For the record, he gets nearly everything a 2 year old could dream of.  Also, now that he's around, it's been near impossible to discuss a job because that would mean daycare.  I've tried to tell her it's more than money, it gets her out of the house, and working on a career for later when he's in school.

Sorry, tried to be brief and squeeze in 6 years of anxiety/frustration.

If not, do you just give up and try to find another way to become debt free?",0

I am a step-mother to 8 and 10 year old girls. We will have them all summer.

That being said, I am looking for recommendations for chore charts, how you do allowance, and any other tips!

I was thinking of giving them certain assigned tasks and paying them for that, and then if they help with anything extra (help me wash the car, etc) give them another small payment. 

Their mother is not wonderful with money... and that’s something that’s scares my husband and I. We want to instill some appreciation for money into them (and also get them thinking about saving for a car, etc!).

To help them lean toward saving money vs spending, I was thinking that we could make them a deal that whatever they put in their savings account, we would match.

Also $10,000 left on an $11,000 car loan for a 2014 Nissan Sentra for husband's long commutes.

Since we have no other debt (except house) we both think we should be hammering the HELOC and leave the car for later.  I know it's against the order of BS2, but I want this HELOC off our shoulders because it's tied to the house and the interest rate/compound daily is really bugging me.

Our mortgage balance is $229,000 and the value is $900,000. Yes you read that right.

My first bill that I paid off was my 2000$ ambulance bill. I had negotiated that bill out of collections and was sending $25 checks every single month. I was so excited when I finally paid it off.

t3_bn4beo,Debt Free Journey!,"  

Hello r/daveramsey community. Since I can’t go on the show to do my debt free scream, I figured sharing my story to this community would be just as good. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my wife and I are 27 years old (I turn 27 on Sunday) we had a combined debt total of a little over $42,000 consisting 100% of my student loans. To begin this process, we had a combined household income of approximately $140,000. We had a hiccup about halfway through where my wife ended up losing her job our income then dropped down to $90,000 through the rest of our journey. We paid off this amount in exactly 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

We started this journey a little over a year ago. I decided that I wanted to do the Dave Ramsey thing. I had been listening to his podcast for about 6 months and wanted to push through these baby steps. The first couple of months I tried doing this all by myself. I found out rather fast that it doesn’t work well that way. I knew that I needed to get my wife on board if we were going to finish this in a timely fashion. Last May we sat down, and I discussed our plans and our financial future together. She was initially not fond of this idea but after talking about it more and more she eventually got on board. 

&amp;#x200B;

We fully started this process the beginning of May. On May 12th (my birthday) I had received some money from family for my birthday, I ended up putting it all towards my student loans. Later that month we had a garage sale where I sold my PlayStation along with all of the games and accessories as well as a bunch of other things that we didn’t need. All of the money made during the garage sale was put towards my student loans. We were on fire throwing in well over $3,000 per month towards our debt. As I stated before my wife ended up losing her job in November and we cut back a bit on the baby steps in order to be sure we were able to take care of all of our monthly expenses. Our original plan was to be debt free in February of this year, but my ultimate goal was to have them paid off before I turned 27. By paying my loans off today I ended up beating my deadline by two days. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had a lot of cheerleaders on our side during this process. My parents have never heard of Dave Ramsey before this but haven’t had a loan in over 20 years. They were never people to go into debt in the first place and that played a huge process in my time growing up. Both of my brothers are debt free as well. My older brother and his wife have both posted blogs about their debt free journey which I will link below. They are currently missionaries in Taiwan. I only got to talk to them on the weekends, but they were pushing us the entire time. My other (younger) brother is also debt free. He was fortunate enough to get a two-year tech degree in a field that pays very well.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the hardest parts in my opinion is delaying the things that we want right now. We made good money so why shouldn’t we go buy a car or take a few nice trips? Delaying the feeling of instant gratification was difficult throughout this process but definitely worth it. I still drive my 2005 Chevy Cobalt with 140,000 miles that I got when I was in high school 9 years ago. My wife drives a 2009 Chevy Impala with 180,000 miles on it. We delayed the trips and delayed the vehicles while our friends were going crazy with racking up debt. Looking back this process has been difficult but more than worth it. We can now start living and giving like no one else.

&amp;#x200B;

Our next goal is to save our three to six moths expenses and pay for a new to us car in cash this fall. We have a couple trips planned next year as well (here we come Disney world). I have lurked on this sub for a long time and hope I will be able to help someone out who is in a similar situation.

t3_bn6990,Tweaking the Baby Steps,"Hello, Reddit!

I'm interested in how you've tweaked some of the baby steps for your particular situation.

I'll go:

My emergency fund is $2,500.

I use a credit card, HOWEVER I have the money for each category in my budget using the envelope method. As I use the credit card, I write it up on the envelope and use the monies in each envelope to pay the card in full each month. I usually have money left over. Sounds tedious but hey, this works for me.",0
t3_bn06g4,WWDD? Where should I focus?,"Hello everyone! I am in BS2 and have been for the past six months. I have been successfully paying down debt to the tune of a couple thousand a month and its been working out really well! I paid off my car two years early and have steadily made massive repayments on my debt. Even with sudden and expensive expenses. 

Unfortunately, mo money, mo problems. I have had a couple of emergencies or school debts that have come up and knocked me off course. Those have been paid and dealt with. 

I currently have the following debts to contend with 

credit card - $9,000

Student Loans - $40,000 (I am in school and these will not begin for at least 9 months)

Summer semesters tuition $4,000 

I currently have $4,000 in the bank. My emergency fund and $3,000 to move. I have an uncomfortable living situation and I am looking to move to start my life again. My living situation is fine but I feel like my life is on pause. I commute three hours a day and am far away from everyone and everything I enjoy. 

The problem is I have to pay this tuition. Normally, I would take out student loans (I know, don't lecture me please unless you have a way for me to magically get 20,000 a year on top of paying down debt.) but I can not take out anymore this year.  The 4k tuition will need to be paid by the end of August so I can register for my final semester. 

I could use the $ I have saved to wipe out the tuition but that will set me back three months from moving. I could slowly pay off the tuition over time and save the money for moving but that will mean I have to neglect my credit card and that really stings because I am accruing something like $150 bucks interest every month! It is also a punch to the gut because this will be the FOURTH time I have started to really attack this credit card and a multi-thousand dollar expense comes up that derails me. 

So what would Dave do? 

What would you do?

t3_bn7m1w,PSLF (public service loan forgiveness) - already pretty far into it.,"Graduated with my masters with around 60k debt.  I work in the public sector and am more than halfway into the 120 payments to be eligible for loan forgiveness.

I considered paying it off a while ago, but decided against it because if I paid it all then - I would have paid 60k - If I did this program, I would spend slightly less and also be able to stretch it out over 7-8 years, so I thought it was a no brainer.  

Im doing pretty good right now.  I dont religiously listen to Dave, but Ive got these steps covered (just to show some background info):

1. No debt (except mortgage and student loans)
2. $1000 emergency fund + up to about 2 months expenses in savings
3. Ive been investing around 10% in my 401k (I need to look into this further - if its the right move)
4. I pay an extra 20% on each mortgage payment which brings my payoff date to 15 years (i know Dave doesnt recommend a 30 year, I wasnt as smart back then)
5. Have an HSA for health expenses
6. The rest of my disposable income goes into trying to make my lifestyle less and less expensive (wood burning stove, put a lot of $$ into my garden, considering solar panels when they become more practical and the price drops)

I think at this point I just need to stay the course and hope for the loan forgiveness.  If it doesnt work out Im gonna be seriously pissed though.  I will end up paying 120,000 or more vs less than 60000 if they decide to screw people who took them up on this offer.",0

t3_bmresz,To snowball... or save for a strike?,"Quick backstory : I work in the grocery industry in WA, and our contract expired earlier this month. We're working under an extended contract while negotiations are underway, usually taking around 4-5 months to hopefully/finally reach an agreement with employers. (The last time there was a grocery strike was 1989 and it lasted for ~3 months). Every three years we go thru this, and the grumblings within the union get worse each time. Six years ago I had picket signs in the back of my car, and the night before we officially went out on strike an agreement was finally reached (about 2 weeks before Thanksgiving).

I just completed my BS1 on May 2nd (YAY!!), and now I'm torn on what to do now. I want to start my BS2, but I feel like I should keep filling my EF with whatever snowballs I get. And in six months  if we don't go on strike, that's great because I'll have a GIANT snowball to throw at my debt (about 14k, all consumer).

I'm on Baby Step 1 right now - building up that $1,000 starter emergency fund.  I have some hundred dollars coming in the way of freelance work next month, which is on top of my regular day job income.  I'm a believer in the power of giving, and historically, I've been a giver, although not a tither.  I've been thinking of beginning to tithe to my church next month, as giving away 10% of my income last month has already changed my mind and heart for the better, if not miraculously gotten me out of debt yet.  The majority of it was towards charitable and political causes dear to my heart, and only a small fraction was to the church I attend.  I can honestly say I've felt more at peace and more selfless than I have in many, many years.

Here's my question: since I'm only on Baby Step 1, should I be tithing, or giving at all?  Or would it be wiser to put every dollar I can towards that emergency fund?  Should I wait until I'm on Baby Step 2 to do this?

If any of you give or even tithe, either to a spiritual entity or to various organizations, at which Baby Step did you start?  And how important (if at all) is giving money away to your debt-free journey?  Some people swear by it.  Some people believe it's one big hoax.  Is giving beneficial or detrimental to paying off debt and eventually building wealth?",0
t3_bmnspr,Do I need an Emergency Fund??,"I am currently 20 years old and about to graduate with my bachelors this fall.

If I continue my plan, I should be able to pay off all my student loans 5 months after graduation.

My question is, should I use my current emergency fund of $1000 to begin paying off now and reduce my time being paid (therefore minimizing additional interest)? This would allow me to pay my loans off quicker, while still living under my parents roof. I have no other debt or payments. I am trying to figure out if I need an emergency fund when I am still a dependent, or if I can pay the loans off and then put my $1,000 away.

t3_bm6vri,"Officially at the ""weird"" stage and LOVE it!","Little backstory -

27, not married, SO currently in college. I'm an insurance agent full time and on nights/weekends I deliver pizza and run a small eBay store selling video game consoles that I repair/refurbish. I started delivering pizza 10 days ago, and in those \~6 shifts I've made over $500! The days can be long, but it's totally worth it to reach my goal - debt free and ready to buy a home in 18 months (when my SO finishes college).

Since I've started attacking debt like it owes me money some people close to me have raised questions.

* My mother thinks I went broke and offered to loan me money. I explained my plan and she thinks I work too much, but understands the importance of eliminating debt. Her boyfriend is a workaholic like me and loves the idea. He asks me what I made in delivery tips almost every night, he's a great guy.
* My brother is in the Coast Guard so we often talk at weird hours depending on his shifts. Last night I got home around 1am (with about 80 bucks in tips from \~6 hours). and was telling him I had just gotten home, he says ""yeah but when the fuck do you sleep""?
* My SO also thinks I work too much, but because of my financial education, she looks to me to make most financial decisions (though we both agree combining finances after college/marriage and working as a team is the plan), she looks to me to create the detailed plan, which I admit I'm certainly willing and able to do.

I remember Dave talking about being weird, and I finally know what that really means. I'm going to have to turn down money from family, and answer questions from colleagues, I told my girlfriend last night that we're living like no one else today so that in the future we can live like no one else.

also - highly recommend pizza delivery as a second job if you're looking for spare cash. Local chain near my house was desperate for drivers, got hired at the interview, and make anywhere from 60-80 bucks (in cash tips, not including hourly pay) on a weekday night, to $135 on a busy Friday night. Long hours, but very rewarding to leave with a handful of cash!",0

As happy as I am, looking forward at the $50K I still have left which I've calculated to take me just under 3 years to complete and then continuing that intensity to build BS3 for another year seems so daunting.

t3_blrx2x,Feeling guilty/illegitimate about my BS status,"Hi All,

As the title states, I’m at a crossroads. I’m currently on BS7 (yay!) but the way I got here has me feeling like it isn’t legitimate. TLDR at bottom.

I started down the DR path four years ago after a friend told me about it.

My main debt was student debt (about $50k) and I got it down to about $19k after really applying myself and over the span of 2 1/2 years-ish.

In November of 2018, I lost my mother after a long battle with cancer. Fortunately, she had all of her finances in order, including a paid off house which my siblings and I inherited.

With her personal life insurance policy, I paid off the remaining debt and saved the remainder. I started investing, single, have no children, have 1/3 of a paid for house, and don’t really want anything at the moment (a newer car eventually, but my paid for car works just fine!).

We’re awaiting life insurance and investment money from her work’s 401k.

While I’m happy that I’m debt-free and EXTREMELY grateful for the financial gift my late mother left me and my siblings, it doesn’t feel legitimate. Sure, I started on my journey a few years ago, but it just feels like I don’t deserve any of this money...especially not at the cost of my mom’s life.

Hopefully this makes sense.

I’m working on figuring out all my monthly expenses. I rent out part of my house. I don’t count that as income since they pay it directly to my mortgage company and the other bills directly to the company.

t3_bly8y3,BS2 Pay off strategy (need advice) WWDD,"I am having some difficulty with how to approach my debt snowball. I have a total of about $200k in debt with an annual salary of just over $100k. I plan to kill the debt with payments of $5-6k/month with a goal of finishing this snowball in 4 years. The debt is broken down like this:
Car Loan: 18k 
Private student loan: 70k
Gov student loan: 112k 

I have my ED budget and $1k emergency fund in place. 

So in this scenario, I would use the debt snowball approach to pay down the car first, followed by the private SL and finishing with the massive gov loan. Here's the thing...My government loans are serviced by Great Lakes and are a collection of 11 separate student loans. Great Lakes provides the option of allocating any extra money to whichever loan I want, or I can just attack the whole balance with the extra money applied to the highest interest rate. It is frustrating because every time I log into the GL account, I can see the total balance over $100k, so the whole psychological benefit of the debt snowball is void when I have to stare at that number every time I log in. I know that a solution to this could be auto-pay and be out of site out of mind about it, but I am the type that has to constantly be looking at my accounts to see progress. In addition, I was on an income based repayment program before starting DR's TMM where my minimum payments were $0 based on circumstances beyond this discussion. This $0 payment will last until next March. 

My question is, would I be going against Dave's plan by paying off the car loan first which has a minimum of $340 and then attacking the 2 student loans as lump sums, instead of individual loans? With the $0 minimum payment on the gov loan, it would seem beneficial to use that to my advantage by paying off the car and private loans and then attack the gov loan full steam ahead with everything I have.

* Currently needs $1500 in maintenance and repairs.
* Said repairs will not increase value of the car.
* No longer feel comfortable driving long distances with it.

* Textbook everyday millionaires, combined net worth is \~$1.5 million (mostly real estate and 401Ks)
* Combined yearly income $350K (I work in engineering, she works in fashion).
* Monthly expenses, tithing, etc. $4K.
* Debt free, own our home (home value \~$650K).
* Fully funded emergency fund and retirement.
* We keep separate savings/brokerage accounts - I have access to $120K, she has \~$40K accessible.
* Wife has a car with a book value of about $25K.

* Brand new is about $45K.
* Used and like-new is about $30K.
* Plan on keeping the car for a minimum 5 years.
* One car argue this car would be family friendly (we would make great use of it).

&amp;#x200B;

On paper, yes, I can afford the car.  But what frightens me is the unknown of us dropping to a single income family in about a year's time would cause me remorse for the car.

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping for feedback ...

&amp;#x200B;

Given my situation, would others view it as foolish to take $30K of the $120K to buy the car?  The $30K would be replenished by the year's end.",0

t3_bldlpg,My car needs a new clutch (transmission)...,"...but thanks to the baby steps, it's not an emergency.

Crazy coincidence. Literally right after we paid cash for my wife's new (to us) car, we walked out of the dealership, I got in mine and it broke! Right there in the dealership lot LOL. My mechanic said it will cost $1500 to drop the transmission, replace the clutch, machine the flywheel and put it all back together. I thought that was pretty high, so I bought the clutch myself online for cheaper. The job will now cost about $1000. When it's done, I'll pay the bill and drive away in my fixed up car with the windows down in the good weather, music blasting!

We're on BS6 so thankfully this doesn't hurt us at all. In fact we don't even have to touch our emergency fund, we have some cash sitting around as a line of defence even before having to use the emergency fund! 

What used to be an emergency is now just an inconvenience... have to rent a car. Oh well! Thanks Dave.",0
t3_blfxzu,Deer hit - fix or pocket the cash?,"Long story short - 14 years ago I went through the baby steps and was debt free.  Stayed mostly debt free aside from a house until about 7 years ago, thanks to a spendy now ex-wife got into debt.  A year after the divorce has settled I was starting my gazelle jump... and instead a deer jumped out in front of me. 


So I just - literally on Friday - completed BS1 by funding my initial $1k emergency fund.  I'm heading into BS2 with a full head of steam then on the way home from dinner Friday night a deer jumped out in front of my truck.  


Now I'm thinking - do I get it fixed, or use that cash as a further jumpstart into BS2.  Truck is a 2011, I'm keeping it because it **will** be paid off in 18 months as part of BS2, it has a warranty, it can fit all my kids in it, and I drive a lot so I need something reliable.  My work mileage reimbursement pays the base payment each month.  


Damage seems to be all cosmetic.  Bumper has a dent on the driver's side, a foglamp got knocked out, the fender got slightly bent out, and the passenger headlight got cracked.  My guess is the estimate will be ~2k and I carry a $500 deductible.  Were I going to sell it in the next 12 months I'd get it fixed, but at this point I'm seeing it with gazelle eyes and instead of this being my first dip into the emergency fund right when I'm starting, instead this being a kickstart into BS2.  The body damage would annoy me less (I'm kind of a perfectionist) knowing that in probably 14 months the truck will be paid off.  Of course it is a risk given that if I choose not to fix it, my value would drop pretty hard.

t3_blihak,How should I go about paying for Grad School? | BS2,"The program I  want to go into is designed for 2 years. Its \~$25k. My job offers tuition assistance in the amount of $5,250. Per year. Currently, I'm on BS2 and make 63k/year. I'm 3 months in throwing 1.8k-2k at my debt each month. At this rate, I should be debt free in 18 months or so. I'm also living at home with no real expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

If I rely solely on tuition assistance this 2-year programs becomes an almost 5-year program and I don't want to have to do that. I also know the debt is absolutely not an option. I'm not sure how much I can get from grants or scholarships; I'll begin looking into it. Scholarships and grants aside I know I should (and will probably have to) save for classes. My question then would be should I wait until I'm debt free or can I put money aside now for classes. I'm considering starting classes in the Spring of 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

My new degree will bring me from 63k to around 78k-81k locally and 99k nationwide and will help me transition in spaces that I have more of a passion for.

t3_bl2mxj,When to replace vehicle?,"Hello all,
Thanks for taking the time to offer any advice on my situation.

I have a 1998 ford explorer that seems to be running into more maintainence problems over the last year than it has at any time before.  Last month I spent about $400 on repairs.  The check engine promptly came on again about a week later.  It's either an O2 sensor or an exhaust leak.  My coworker is pretty good with vehicles and said to ignore it for now but to check the code weekly incase it changes and it's really more of a noise issue than anything. I know nothing about vehicles and she fixes hers all the time so I trust her advice.

That said, I have $6000 left in student loan debt (down from $11k in December).  My question is when should I look for a newer vehicle since I have no clue when my car will die.  I am obsessed with paying off my debt but I also don't want to be caught with my pants down either with a broken car and only $1k towards repairs/new vehicle.

So what I was thinking of doing was putting $250 every paycheck to my savings for a combo car/debt fund while paying the minimum on my student loan.  If my car lasts long enough, I can pay off the smaller of my 2 remaining student loans in 3 months (this doesn't count any commission I get) in a lump sum with the saved money.  I have $2200 left on it.  If my car craps out, at least I'll have more money to pay any repairs or for a new vehicle and not dip back into credit while maintaining my $1k emergency fund.

I know it's not following the baby steps 100% doing it this way since that $250 each paycheck has a dual purpose possibly but I'd appreciate any thoughts on whether this is wise.  Thanks!",0

I first read TMM about 15 years ago and have half assed followed it. I’m at a turning point in my life now and have the opportunity to try to turn things around but I just can’t get over the idea of having to go back to renting.

Im in the process of getting divorced. 43 female. 1 child still at home. My stbxh is a gambling addict and has driven us into the ground financially- one of the reasons we’re splitting up. 

Income:
$3,052 net every two weeks 
$1,400 in child support 

Contributing 6% for my 401k. $17k balance. Reluctant to stop this as I don’t want to end up like my parents at retirement and I’m already way behind 

Current monthly outlay:
$2,500 mortgage 1 (Bal 222k @ 4.5%)
$1,200 mortgage 2 (took out a 2nd loan to payoff ex’s gambling debt 2 years ago when he promised to quit. He didn’t) (Bal 94k at 7.5%)
$900 child care 
$700 groceries/toiletries 
$250 student loans 
$400 gas
$115 car insurance 
$600 credit cards 
$600 utilities (electric, gas, internet, Netflix) 

Debt:
$20,000 Student loan payment $250
$5,000 AmEx payment $70 (usually pay way over the min)
$13,000 Chase $125 min payment 
222k mortgage 1 @ $2500 per month 
94k 2nd mortgage @ 1200 per month 

No car payment- car is paid off

I have $75k from my annual bonus and savings. I’d like to use it to sell my current house. According to my realtor, I’ll need to put in about $15k worth of repairs to get it ready for sale (hardwood floors are in bad shape, kitchen needs to be updated, some painting, repairs, etc).

So, that leaves 60k leftover from my 75k. If it sells for 315k, I’ll end up needing $40k to close as I’m in the hole due to the insane property taxes here, 2nd mortgage and closing costs.

That now leaves me $20k. I’ll need some money to pay for movers (I have no friends or family to help me) and to pay for the next place. 

I really, really, really do not want to rent. I have two dogs that I am going to find a hard time getting a landlord to approve taking on (2 100+ pound Great Danes) and I have had horrible experiences with landlords. Rentals in an area that I would want to live in are going to end up costing me more than a mortgage would and now I’m uoheaving my son again later on to move again once I can save more of a down payment. 

I am torn on taking my remaining funds and making a small down payment on a much less expensive house (150-200k) that would have my payment around $1200-$1600 depending on which area I moved to (property taxes vary based on schools here in IL).

I’d be saving over $2000 a month that I could then use to knock out my remaining debt in less than a year.

Every bit of overtime that i earned has been going to my debt snowball. So far i have paid off about 14k in debt. I have payed off everything but  my student loan. My student loans are a giant mountain of debt. I owe 80k on my education. All this extra money that im throwing on my student loans doesnt seem to be amounting much. It feels like i am barely chipping away at this debt. To make matters worse im physically drained from all the over time and side hustles i have been working. I dont think i can keep working at this pace for the next 2.5 years were i should be debt free. Im on the brink of giving up. Any ideas on how to maintain momentum? Ive been trying to listening daily to the podcast for motivation but lately that hasn't  seemed to help.,0
t3_bk477v,Baby Steps 3B / 4. Is it OK to move into nicer rental home?,"Hi there, we are debt free in the SF bay area. Our income is about $300k with take home around $210k. We have been putting aside ~$100k per year to save for a house and have $220k so far. We will probably save for 3-4 more years to get up to $600k.

Our apartment right now is ok, and costs $3k per month, but I don't really want to stay in an apartment for 3+ more years. We are looking at renting a house for $3.6k per month. The rent tends to increase ~7% per year, so a $600/mo decision today is a $730/mo decision in 3 years.

What would Dave do? Is it ok to spend 20% more to enjoy our living space more, or is it time for more intense saving?",0
t3_bk3bui,Snowball Payment - Start or End of Month?,"Today I paid off my car and I am now moving on to student loans. My plan is to put $1800 a month towards my loans starting May 15.

My question is should I make my $1800 payment at the beginning of the pay period to ensure I do it or should I wait until the end of the month to make sure I don’t need any of that money for something? 

I am inclined to think my best bet is to start off just paying the $1800 so I can be forced into weekly spending accountability. What do you all think?",0

The house had 11 offers in 24 hours and all i know is the sellers accepted an offer with no inspection. Right now we can only afford 135k for a house but most houses are selling way over asking price. I don't want to be stuck in 3B for ever because that would mean a late start for our retirement plus a late start for other baby steps. I have talked to my wife about this and she knows what Dave says about 3B but she does not want to budge until we buy a house. At this rate we could be in step 3b for a few more years.,0

Anyway, we financed a car in November 2018. Buyers remorse sets in. Baby steps in January 2019, when we had this kind of debt:

Vehicle: $15,000
Student Loan 1: $35,000
Student Loan 2: $44,000

Luckily, we had enough in savings to finish BS1 immediately as well as cash flow an auto insurance policy, child care costs for our oldest son, leaving a little more left over to prime the pump for BS2. 

We have been very fortunate on the income side, able to throw $4,000-$5,000 at debt every month after expenses. Here’s where we’re at today...

Vehicle: paid off in March
Student Loan 1: $24,900
Student Loan 2: $44,000

I’m proud of what we’ve been able to do when focused, though I still feel a bit antsy that it’s not happening fast enough! Any tips, pointers on being more content with the process? Or is it supposed to suck?

Lookin forward to the convos, hearing others’ situations!",0
t3_bjhuat,BS2 completed!,"In November of 2018, my husband and I decided to look into Dave Ramsey and his methods.  We were a bit skeptical at first, but after our first month of using a cash budget saved us $600 from our normal budget, we became big believers!  It took us a few months to get our cash budget right, and each month we've tried to spend less cash than we have to put additional funds back towards our debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Our aggressive goal was to have our student loans and credit cards paid off by June - I am so happy to post that we reached that milestone in April all thanks to Dave's methods! We got a huge jump-start by using our year-end bonuses towards paying off our debts and had weekly meetings to discuss our budget along with setting a monthly financial goal together.

&amp;#x200B;

Even after filing for the IRS and discovering we owed $4,340, we did not let that set us back.  In fact, we were able to pay the IRS in full in cash!  This would not have been possible a year or two ago and while it was not fun paying the IRS, it was amazing to be able to pay in cash!  This was our first full year of being married, so we have since adjusted our W4s in anticipation of next year's taxes.

Thank you to everyone on this sub for all of your helpful information, advice and support! My husband and I are so happy to be ""weird"" and are ready to live like no one else.

We have cut our expenses to live on the smaller income between the two of us and are using our second income to save.

I stumbled on to Dave in January as a new year resolution to be out of debt and onto owning my income and becoming an everyday millionaire.  January went well, but I did not really buy on and start making moves till my mom gifted me the Dave Ramsey's Complete Guide to Money in March after she took FPU.  April, I rocked it out.  I cut my spending, got my emergency fund up to 1000, picked up a second job, and paid 3500 towards debt.  I have been gazelle intense, but today my car's brake pads were making a not so nice noise, so I am going to have to use my emergency funding to fix my car.  I am going to use Dave's tip of wheeling and dealing to see if my cash payment will knock the price down a little bit.  What I am beating myself up about is: this is not a ""true emergency"" because I know car maintence is a normal expense and I can plan for it.  Last month, I budgeted $55 to be put in a ""fund"" in the EveryDollar App to start this fund, but the maintence came sooner than planned. :(

My question to the community: When in Baby Step 2, how much of our excess cash (that we would like to put into my debt snowball) is appropiate to put a side for these planned emergencies?  How gazelle intensity should I be on my debt?  Does anyone have a number they like to put away a month for car maintence and repair? and If you do have a monthly amount, when do you cap it (aka stop funding it)?

I wanted to update you all on what a good month it's been!

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some key points:

1. We paid $5000 towards our debt this month!!!
2. Moved my business expenses out of personal expenses and started giving myself a paycheck (I think this was crucial!!)
3. Brought monthly expenses down to $6857. (Mostly this was just by separating personal &amp; business. I think our expenses are really high just because we have a god awful amount of debt we have but if something seems way too high please let me know.)
4. I listened to Dave Ramsey pretty much daily - I legit tear up at the debt-free screams.
5. Got my mother to be my accountability partner.
6. Switched to Everydollar (WAYYYYY easier than YNAB, in my opinion).

&amp;#x200B;

The cons:

1. Even though we did SO much better than last month, we still overspent in almost every category, although I've heard that's normal when you are getting started. For some categories, I had no idea what to put. I will have a better idea next month.
2. Traveling to see my family in Easter really messed us up, how do you all travel on the cheap?

It all looked great until my finance company attacked. They hear the words, mobile home, and start to grimace. I get that they are hesitant to loan when part of the package is a mobile that is depreciating in value.

The past few years I've been aggressively investing in my retirement (Roth TSP), but as I shift locations I would also like to shift my investments around a little bit.

&amp;#x200B;

Searching for the best methods to earn extra income on the side is sort of like searching for the best way to lose weight, 1000 opinions, most of which are utter nonsense. I've personally come across countless articles with titles like ""bring in an extra 1000/month"" and their advice is something like ""become a secret shopper"" or ""write a blog"". These things are extremely unlikely to generate even a modest income, let alone 1000/month.

t3_bisc7z,One year makes all the difference,"Hi guys! I started my debt free/wealth building journey in April 2018 and now that I've officially been working at it for a year I wanted to share my progress! Last year I made $52,000 (before tax) and I'm single (27) living in a HCOL city.

&amp;#x200B;

Last April I found myself filing taxes for the 2016 and 2017 years. I had school credits but I also had a bunch of untaxed freelance work and when all was said and done I had a nice big $3200 tax bill. Ouch. That was the kick in the butt I needed to take a look at my financial picture as a whole. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bad news? Between the tax bill and my student loans, I owed $13,001. The good news? I had $9,000 in my checking account as an emergency fund as my freelance income can vary wildly.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing I did was pay that tax bill. Immediately. No need to rack up any more fines for paying late. Then I set up a budget. I use Mint to keep all of my transactions and accounts in one spot and keep myself honest. While my first budget looked pretty good, it's changed a lot and a year later I finally feel like I have the hang of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, it was time to beat down those student loans. I didn't immediately drop down the emergency fund. I only have my income to count on and I'm in a very volatile industry in a HCOL area. But by throwing every extra dollar at the debt, picking up extra freelance gigs and chipping down that emergency fund as the debt number started to shrink, I took the leap in August 2018 bringing my E fund down to $1000 and saying goodbye to the student loans for good. Because I had that large chunk in savings when I began that journey, I feel like Baby Step 3 was much harder for me to complete than Step 2.

&amp;#x200B;

It took me 7 months (Sept. 2018 - Apr. 2019) to build my 6 month emergency fund back up ($12,000) while cash flowing weddings, Christmas, a class to boost my freelance skills, among other things.

&amp;#x200B;

So what now? Being in a HCOL area, property ownership is out of the question right now. There are no immediate or long term plans for kids, so I'm excited to be throwing everything I've got at getting my retirement on track!

t3_bitqf2,Gaining Debt and Weight,"I was thinking about this today: It is very easy to gain debt and gain weight---especially in the USA. But trying to reduce debt and weight is a struggle for most people. In most cases, it takes WORK to reduce debt and weight. I live in this culture that encourages consumerism. Any time I turn on the TV set, or just take a drive down the street, I get all sorts of advertisements in my face about getting loans or buying some tasty food. I'm sure corporations spend billions of dollars on these advertisements because they are very effective.

&amp;#x200B;

Typical TV ad: 

""No money? Bad credit? No problem! We have easy payment plans. No payments until September!"" 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like every year I gain 5 pounds. When I was in my 20s, it wasn't hard to stay under 170 pounds. Now I'm 50 years old and weigh 230 pounds. I can't run a city block without getting out of breath, but I could jog 5 miles when I was 40 years old. Being overweight makes me feel tired. I'm too tired to exercise. Sometimes I get a strong temptation to eat some fast food right after work. I work in a shopping center, and I'm surrounded by restaurants. As I walk across the parking lot to my car, my mind begs me to go to a drive-thru and buy a cheeseburger. Sometimes I just give in, and other times I drive strait home and prepare a cheap meal for dinner. I'd be better off eating a salad, but the problem is: salads don't taste like cheeseburgers.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get applications for credit cards in the mail, I'll occasionally read the introductory letter and think to myself, ""Hmmm...I guess it wouldn't be so bad to have another credit card...you know...just in case I need some extra money."" But I have to remind myself that the reason I'm in debt is because it was too easy to get a credit card or a loan. I have to tear those those letters up and throw them in the trash so they won't influence my mind. When banks offer me credit, it make me feel like a junkie surrounded by drug dealers. It's like, I can get a ""quick fix"" instead of experiencing the delayed gratification that comes from saving money. 

&amp;#x200B;

I watch Dave Ramsey videos and I read the forum posts here to get inspired to work toward a better life. I need a daily dose of positive, uplifting advice in order to save myself from myself. I'm really good at messing up my life, and this environment of mass consumerism makes it easy for me to do so.  I have to keep my mind focused on my future well-being if I'm going to avoid all this temptation to spend and eat foolishly. I struggle with this DAILY. 

&amp;#x200B;

t3_bisr47,NerdWallet - Total Accounts - Poor rating. Gotta love this...,"I just got an email from NerdWallet saying that I'm SO close to a better rating, and a ""key takeaway"" is that I only have 4 accounts open, and to get a better score, I need more accounts.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just closed one of those, my car loan that I paid off a year early last Thursday, the 2nd is my Chase cc that I'm keeping open but never bringing with me, and in all honesty, I forgot that the other two accounts are even open.  They are all credit cards with $0 balances.  Yup, I have no debt at all as of last Thursday.  So I login to NerdWallet to see what they suggest, just for the fun of it.  Here's what they suggest I do to get my credit score up:  


1 -  Add a new credit card with a $10,000 limit 

2 -  Add a new $20,000 auto loan 

3 -  Add a new $15,000 personal loan   


What will all these ""suggestions"" do to my credit rating?  According to NerdWallet, if I add the credit card, my score goes DOWN 4 points.  If I do the auto loan, my score goes DOWN 19 points.  And if I get the personal loan, my score goes DOWN 32 points.    


I must be doing something right, if my total amount of accounts is POOR, but all of their suggestions would lead to an even lower credit rating haha I had to chuckle at that.    


Also, time to close those other 2 accounts I forgot about.  What a poor way of trying to help people manage their finances, with only showing them how adding MORE debt will help their credit rating.  I'm so glad I'm on the Dave Ramsey plan now!",0

Personally, most people I talk to say something along the lines of ""Yea, I like Dave's plan alright, but it's for people who aren't disciplined... I pay my card off every month, so it doesn't apply to me"" or my brother in law, who will agree with most of what I say, but doesn't follow the plan. He's got a ""snowball"" but not really a budget... oh and he's paying on his largest debt first.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to tell him to start with my sisters car loan (their smallest debt), then his car loan (slightly larger than the first), but he wants to pay the highest interest rate first (a different debt, twice as big as the car debts). I've explained how freeing up the cash flow will actually get him out of debt faster (and put him in a better position to deal with emergency expenses) by paying off the cars first, but it doesn't matter. Then he said something like ""Well once we get her car paid down some, we can trade it in for something nicer..."" so remaining debt free isn't even his goal.

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying everyone has to agree or do the plan... but it's surprising to me how many people just have no desire to ever be debt free.

t3_bim9ho,Does no debt whatsoever make sense?,"One of the central tenets of Ramsey's approach to finance is that debt is whatever form is bad. He seems to be less adamant about this with regards to mortgages, but part of his story is being burned in his younger days with 4 million in home loans with 1 mill of equity and losing it all. I'm someone who has benefited from some of his insights, but I consider myself pretty financially sound and well-schooled (own rental properties free-and-clear with the help of my parents, no debt besides medical school loans, headed to residency very soon), and like many others, I find a good portion of his advice a bit regressive and unhelpful.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: does having no debt whatsoever really make that much sense? I understand avoiding over-leveraging, and exposing yourself to the risk of getting wiped out when those huge perturbations to the economy roll around, but I just wonder how many gains I'd be missing out on if I just plowed any extra cash into index funds versus taking out loans (conservatively of course) to buy rental properties. Is he just avoiding the concepts of ""good"" debt (i.e. income generating, debt whereby you are cash flow positive) vs ""bad"" debt because, like his idea of the debt snowball and tackling the lowest interest rate loans first, his techniques are more psychologically sound than mathematically sound, and designed for those who are really in the gutters financially? I mean, maybe I'd find if I avoided debt, I'd actually end up saving and investing more over a lifetime, and end up way better off than if I relied on leverage?

&amp;#x200B;

Dave Ramsey has a net worth of somewhere around $70 mill, and apparently that's all without debt. I just wonder common it is to find entrepreneurs or business folks who have achieved significant success without debt like that.",0

t3_bi6i2x,"""Just out of curiosity, why not finance?""","My wife and I are car shopping for a new (used) car for her. Our max budget is 15k, cold hard cash. We went to 4 dealerships today and the first thing we let them know is we're looking to pay up to 15k cash out the door. This narrowed our options quite a bit and they were deadset on explaining to us how financing works and its ""benefits"". We are mid-20's, debt free and on BS6 (no kids yet). 

All 4 dealership employees that we spoke to all asked ""Can I ask why you're against financing? It can really help you get something new, like a 2018 or 2019. Your payment could be as low as $300/month for a brand new car"". We just nodded and smiled, knowing there was zero chance we were about to be convinced to go into debt. ""Thanks, we get that, but we prefer to just stick with cash. We don't do debt.""

One of them even tried to tell us that, and I quote, ""A car payment is the best thing you can have on your credit report, it's great for your credit score! You guys are young so you might not know this, but it's good to have a high credit score if you ever want to buy a house one day. Just my advice."" We smiled and nodded, knowing we already own a house! Thanks but no thanks. It feels great to know that your partner is the same as you when it comes to good money management. I feel grateful that she's not the naive blow-money-and-go-into-debt type. It's just crazy that they really expect *everybody* to just get a car payment, because sooooo many people have them. It's normal to everybody. But we have no interest in being normal.

Long story short, we're interested in a 2015 Honda Civic. We're going to text drive it on Monday and if it feels right and she likes it, we'll take it home... paid for... in cash.

About 50% of my clients are cash and don’t bill insurance and those who do bill insurance typically don’t tip.

Since my paycheck isn’t heavily reliant on tips, I haven’t been using them toward my snowball. So far, I’ve been counting the tips that show up on my paycheck (from clients paying with cards) as part of my snowball and have been using the cash I get as “fun” money.

I told her my goal is to not depend on CS at all because who knows what the future could bring.  He could loose his job, get hit by a bus, or take me back to court.  Best case scenario I could live off my wages and use the CS to get the house paid off, have a ""new to me"" car fund and have a good chunk saved for my kids' college and anything else they might need in the future (first car, braces, extracurricular activities, etc).

t3_bi833x,Prioritizing BS6,"Sharing our situation in regards to BS 4/5/6 (and eventually 7). Our income rose back to where it was pre-child and we allocated a lot of the extra cash flow to retirement and college savings for a few months. Now that we have reached what we consider to be acceptable amounts in both areas, we’ve decided to shift more toward the house payoff for security reasons. Our retirement election is now 15% (20% with match) and we’ve paused college savings for 2-3 years in order to pursue a more stable situation for our young family.

We’ll continue to pay down the house aggressively until we’re around $100k remaining in 3 years, then decide how best to move forward. We have the option to recast the loan if lowering the monthly payment is attractive to us. I believe turning the investing/college faucet back up would coincide with a mortgage recast. Full payoff at this pace would take 5 years.

Stats:

$260k Mortgage (~$300k at origination), 13.5 yrs left

$300k Retirement

$25k Cash Accounts

$5k College Savings (baby)

t3_bi508b,Terrified to lose emergency fund,"All - I'm very sorry in advance if this post is too lengthy.

I am hoping to get some advice from all of you. I'm a 34 year old, single but living with someone, and I've recently realized I do not have it together financially, even though I thought I did.  Finding the debt free community and here I am.

I make 75k a year plus a bonus of about 12k that isn't being paid this year due to company performance (not mine, but the company as a whole).

I am preparing to have surgery sometime in the next three months, during which I will be out of work for at least 4 weeks, but probably 6.  During that time I expect to receive 100% of my salary from short term disability coverage through my employer.

My finances in a nutshell:

* I take home 4016 per month.  My boyfriend contributes 942 per month towards mutual expenses.
* I have 73k in retirement accounts, most of that is my 401(k).  Only a few hundred is in a Roth.
* I have a dedicated 25k emergency fund I have saved despite having debt because my income/health is shaky.  Including my emergency fund, my total bank balance is 35k, much of which is saved for my out of pocket maximum this year for the surgery.
* I am going to school to finish my bachelor's degree to improve future job prospects (accounting), but my employer pays the entire amount.
* I have a lot of debt - 22k on 1 credit card at 10%, 14.8k car loan at 2.24%, and 186k mortgage on a house worth 209k at 4.6.

I am terrified of losing my emergency fund, since the future of my income in my current job is very shaky and I cannot easily leave until my health is straightened out and I'm out of school.  If I leave my job voluntarily, I will need to repay some of the tuition assistance.

I've written out a budget, taking out a ton of current expenses and things that aren't necessary and can get together $1k per month to put on top of my other debt payments (380 for the credit card min pay, 379 for the car loan and 770 for my mortgage payment (my portion only).

t3_bi8o8m,Question on 15-year fixed rate home loan,"Hi guys! I am from the Philippines and have been doing the baby steps. We are now at baby step 3b - so we are debt-free with 6 months worth of emergency fund.

We have just recently put down a 20% down payment on a house and are now looking into financing the 80%.

I know Dave is adamant about the 15-year fixed rate rule. After checking, our mortgage will be 23% of our monthly income so that means we will not be house-poor.

However, in the Total Money Makeover book, Dave assumes that the current interest rates are at its lowest, as in the case in the US. In the Philippines, the rates are at a high (10.5%) due to a high inflation rate last year. (It may be adjusted lower soon.)

Question: Would you recommend a variable rate for this situation? A 5-year fixed rate perhaps for a 15 year loan?

I have found that for everything else, Dave’s very US-based assumptions in his book apply in our country. People behave similarly all over the world anyway. But could the full term fixed rate mortgage perhaps be an exception?

t3_bi1d2r,Paying off old/new debt question,"Trying to figure out in what order to pay off old debt, recently acquired debt, and plan for a known future debt.

Currently, we have about $7800 in consumer debt (credit cards and a saxophone).  I have them arranged in the debt snowball effect. Per month, minimums, run about $300.

Recently, my daughter had surgery and her medical bills are going to come in at about $4000.  If we get set up on a payment plan, I'd expect about $300? monthly agreement.

In about 2 months, we are getting the kids in dental braces. I expect the bill to come in at about $6000, from previous knowledge.

We have $6000 available to pay off debt today, or in the future (leaves us with $1000 emergency fund). My question is what to pay off first or save for later.  Initially the money in the bank was for paying off the braces, not to acquire new debt. My wife suggested that we pay off the medical, then apply the rest to the future braces (lowering the borrowed amount). Then the topic came up about paying current consumer debt, because of interest, then dealing with the new debt accordingly.

What's hour thoughts? Thank you!!!",0

t3_bhqyig,W-4 Withholding Calculation,"Edit: My husband makes $19/hour at 40 hours per week. I make $12.06/hour at 40 hours per week.

So I've heard Dave say over and over that you should NOT get a tax refund because you're basically letting the government borrow your money for 12 months. I had a really difficult time letting go of the idea of getting a large refund (mine has always been $3K-$5k) because of the fear/anxiety of owing on my taxes.  

We recently had our first baby and have a second on the way. This year our tax refund was well over $7k and with a second baby will probably be close to $8k-$9k next year if we keep doing what we're doing with our withholding.

We recently started our baby steps and are realizing (we're slow on the uptake, it's ok) we could really use that extra money in our paychecks to pay down debt faster. 

I changed my W-4 from ""married withholding at single rate with 0 exemptions"" to ""married with 5 exemptions"" so I'm effectively having $0 federal taxes withheld. This bumped my paycheck (paid every 2 weeks) from $550 net to $630 net.

We have not changed my husband's yet because of my anxiety, but we have his W-4 set at ""married withholding at single rate with 0 exemptions."" His paycheck (paid every 2 weeks) currently nets $1,250. If we change his to ""married with 5 exemptions"" it will also effectively have $0 federal taxes withheld, and should net close to $1,400 per check.

I plugged the new withholding scenario into a few different tax refund calculators. They consistently showed that even if we change his withholding now, we are still set to get around $2k refund.

*Our state does not have a state income tax.

I'm nervous that I'm making a calculation error somewhere and we're going to end up with a giant tax bill next spring. If anyone is willing to check my numbers or give me any feedback, I would really appreciate it.",0
t3_bhitv3,Just paid off my first debt...on to the next!,"Hi friends! I just made my last credit card payment, ending a decade-long cycle of keeping my credit card maxed out pretty much constantly. That’s $7k in debt gone, and I have $9500 remaining on my car and $42k in student loan debt. For context, I’m 30, my income is $80k, and my expenses equal about half my income as I live in a low cost of living area. Currently I’m putting about $2k per month toward debt, so I’m incredibly excited to have my car paid off by the end of September and then focus all my energy on my student loans.

t3_bhfgbi,"She's gone...I miss her already, and I blame Dave!","Yesterday I made one of the toughest decisions of my life...when I sold my motorcycle...haha sorry for the misleading title but I thought it was appropriate... I know this decision was for the best so I can become financially secure, but it was tough!  I paid cash for it, so all of the proceeds of the sale was for me to use as needed.

With the proceeds, I single handedly lowered my monthly budget($62/mo for insurance), paid off my 4Runner with $2800 to complete BS2, added $2k into my savings account to complete my 6 months expenses for BS3, and put the rest into savings for a house!  It's not much for a house yet, but this is a HUGE start for me!

It was funny, I took a side job in an effort to earn more money to pay off my 4Runner early, and I was working less hours than initially anticipated, so I started trying to figure out what I could do to speed this process up.  A few weeks ago, I was in my garage cleaning up a few things, and realized that I had a paid-for toy, which I didn't need, but wanted (real bad!), and decided to make the tough decision that I know is best for my future.  Now the money I have made from my side job (not much, so far about $1600), I didn't even have to touch, and is all going to go into my savings, and my 401k has already started in anticipation of this happening.

I'm 39, with no debt, about $15k in the bank, about $60k of 401k/pension accounts (from a previous career I ended 4 years ago), and the beginning to the next step.  I'm going to be reading the Total Money Makeover (again!) and start to plan the next phase and set goals.

Thanks to this community and DR for the motivation to get this far!

t3_bhof53,Why can’t I figure out how to start?,"I’m very familiar with the first couple baby steps. $1000 emergency fund, debt snowball, zero based budget using EveryDollar or another platform. Got it. But why can’t I figure out how to get there from here?

Example: let’s start my journey as of May 1 since that sounds easy. As of May 1, I’ve got the month’s income budgeted. Keep $1000 and the rest goes to debt. Well, I’m “normal” as Dave would say, so I’ve got all sorts of debt. Credit card payment due by the 7th, car payment due by 11th, student loans due by the 15th, and etc. According to the budget, my payments will all work out (with excess going toward the smallest debt, hence the snowball) but I’m paid weekly so I won’t necessarily have all the money when the payments are due in the month. Does this make sense? I would understand if I was paid monthly then I’ve got that money in hand on the first of the month to figure out where to allocate it, but I just can’t wrap my head around how to get there from here with weekly income. I know the answer has to be much more simple than I am making the situation, I just can’t figure it out.",0

t3_bhotp1,Everdollar question,"EveryDollar and YNAB are two great systems to manage your money. Every dollar acts more like a living P&amp;L, and YNAB manages money you currently have.

I received a year of everydollar for free. I want to try it. I have put all my accounts into everydollar but I don’t understand how transfers work between accounts. With YNAB, a $300 payment to a credit card works as a transfer (1 transaction) with everydollar they don’t sync up, it acts as two different transactions and then the two transactions cancel each other out. With a positive and negative transaction.  -$300 in checking and +$300 in the credit account.

t3_bho3kz,Take the 401k “free” money or save for emergency fund?,"Hi, just joined the club. Husband and I (both 28) could pay off the last of my cc debt ($5500) and student loans ($3000) within the next 2 months using the $12k he has saved.

Because I have 51k in retirement already, should I stop contributing to my new 401k in order to more quickly amass the 3-6 months living expenses?

1. Financial - Obviously BS2, just put 2600 towards my car, have 8 more of those to pay it off this year, 2 years early. After that I think I'll pump up my Emergency Savings to 30-40k pending my 3 incoming raises this year. It's overkill, I know.
2. Spiritual - None
3. Physical - Need to maintain/lose weight. I'm at around 220, and I think 185 is my max for my age in the Army. But I'm broken so I'm just cutting back on sugar/fast food and making friends with water and veggies.
4. Intellectual - Finishing up my BS and getting 12+ IT certifications by the end of the year.  Class starts Jun 1 @ WGU!  I'll have 6 months and pretty much 12+ hours every day to study. Certs to gain: A+/Net+/Cloud Essentials/Project+/Linux+/CIW-SDA/CCENT/CCNA/CCNA Security/CCDA/IT Ops Specialist/Secure Infrastructure/Specialist. After I'll go for my MS and 2 more certs.
5. Family - None (I had my sister over to watch GoT and looking at my game collection she says ""Why don't you throw away the boxes?"" She's ex-communicated now.
6. Career - Getting that big raise up to 6 figures when I convert from a subcontractor to a regular contractor. Picking up a 2nd job in my field. (I would not do well delivering pizzas lol)
7. Social - None",0

**Debts**

* CC #1 - $18.5k @ 13.24%
* CC #2  - $30k @ 17.49%
* CC #3  - $13.5k @ 13.15%
* CC #4  - $4k @ 4.99%
* CC #5  - $2.4k @ 20.99%
* CC #6  - $5k @ 26.99%
* CC #7  - $1.8k @ 0%
* Student Loan #1 - 1.8k @ 1.625%
* Student Loan #2 - 0.3k @ 1.625%
* IRS - 23k

\--&gt; Total minimum monthly payments - $2k

**Income**

I am a contractor, so I am responsible for my own taxes, etc. (part of my problem I'm in) and I only get paid if I work (no vacation/sick time). I make $114.75/hr which is the good part. I am paid every 2 weeks, so I base this number off of 160 hours/month. I will get 2 other paychecks/year, which I plan to use 100% of towards debt.

\--&gt; Monthly income before taxes - $18,360

**Expenses**

* Taxes - $5.5k
* COBRA - $2.2k (expiring in June, will move to ACA plan @ $1.6k)
* Auto/Life Insurance - $575
* Business Insurance - $130
* Mortgage - $1.5k ($220k balance, house value \~ $300k)
* Utilities - $325
* QuickBooks - $35 (I have an accountant now that will have full access to my books)
* Groceries - $1.5k
* Fuel - $250
* Car Maintenance - $110 (oil changes, scheduled maintenance, etc. We have 2 2013 automobiles that are paid off)
* Gym - $22
* Home Maintenance - $125
* Kids Activities - $200
* Medical - $250 (co-pays, prescriptions, etc)
* Personal Care - $200 (haircuts, personal care products, etc)
* Pets - $100 (2 dogs, 1 cat. Food, vet, etc)
* TV/Internet - $195 (Going to call DirecTV to downsize/cancel, need internet for my job)
* Cell phone - $175
* Software subscriptions - $45 (Google drive, MSFT Office, Netflix, Google Music)
* Dining out - $250
* Clothes - $100
* House cleaning - $135

\--&gt; That leaves me with a little over $5k/month to put towards the debt. Using the debt avalanche method (highest interest first), I'm clear in October of 2020.

**IRS**

The one piece I left out was the IRS. Basically I didn't hold enough for myself and didn't file quarterly so when I filed this month, I was hit with a huge bill that I couldn't fully cover. An extension was filed, but I'm not sure how to approach this one. I have 3 thoughts...

1. Make monthly payments to the IRS before any debt, pay minimums on debt until IRS is paid off. This will push back my debt payoff by 7-8 months. I will end up paying penalties and interest as well.
2. Refinance and take $20k out to cover this bill and allow me to focus on my other debts
3. Call and get on a payment plan if possible. I don't know if I can even do that.

No matter what, I will be reviewing my books monthly with my accountant and filing taxes quarterly to ensure this doesn't happen again.

**Current Status/Plan**

We have about $6.5k of savings thanks to my wife. We are keeping that for our emergency fund which we already have to tap in to because we found mold in our bathroom that is currently being remediated. 

CC use is finished, cash/debit card only. 

Together, we review all expenses weekly to make sure we are on track. I use a Profit/Loss report (get to zero balance) and an expense by category report from QuickBooks to do this. We also input/pay all bills from the previous week at this time.

**TL;DR**

\~$100k of debt, \~$12k/month take home, \~$2k/month debt payment minimums, \~$5k/month for debt

* Should I refinance to pay IRS, get on a payment plan with them, or just pay it off?
* Any other suggestions welcome",0
t3_bhafpe,Around 25K in cc debt,"Hello all.  I’m actually ashamed to type this, but I’ve accumulated around 25k in cc debt alone.  About me, I make around 80k a year.   We won’t discuss wife’s situation as for the moment I’d like to fix mine first.  

I have a house that i pay for myself out of my salary that’s 2k a month.  A car that’s 530 a month.  Cell phone 120 a month.  Electric that’s around 150 a month on the high end usually.  Let’s say I average 130 a month in gas.  Insurance on vehicle 110 or so.  And maybe say 200 a month on food.  Wife buys all the groceries from her budget but sometimes cook asks sometimes doesn’t.  I bring home around 2500 every 2 weeks.  So a bring home pay each month of roughly 5k.  Let’s say after all of my bills are essentials so to speak are paid I have roughly 1600 bring home because here shortly I also will have 240 for health insurance.  With that 1600 how should I be paying on these bills.  I’ve also thought about a personal loan from Alliant credit union to just pay it all off and have one monthly payment, but not sure at this time.

Card with balance and limit 
Home Depot - 488/500 - 35 a month 
Capital 1 - 465/500 -25 a month 
Amex - 960/1000- 35 a month 
American Airlines -640/1000 25 a month 
Navy Federal -17200/17300 ranges but usually try to pay 309 a month 
Navy Federal 6400/6700 usually pay 100 a month 

Both navy federal card have rates of around 16 percent.  The other 3 have your typical 24 percent interest rate for someone like myself.  

Any advice and suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I’d love to tackle my debt head on and be done with it in the next couple of years.",0

t3_bhe54h,Budgeting Services,"I've thought about this many times... helped quite a few friends in the past get their budget in order. However as the people who need budget help the most are typically also really broke, it's never felt like a viable ""side gig"" to me. Plus I hate taking advantage of people's circumstances instead of just helping out when possible.

On the flip side, I have limited free time, and time is valuable.  My background is nearly a decade in corporate treasury, accounting and finance. I'm not some guru that would be able to help rewrite your life if you have 5k in bills a month and make 2k a month... but would there even be a market for a service (I don't really know how much I'd need to even charge for such a thing) to help people put a budget together, going over credit card statements, account balances, amounts due, monthly charges, sinking funds for future expenses, etc?  And then balancing that against income?

I find myself between the DR facebook groups I'm in, and a few posts on here that pop up on my feed just really wanting to help, but at the same time not always being able to justify the time to codify a solid plan for people and help them find savings personalized to their situation.

And I mean helping you set up your everydollar budget, link accounts with your spouse, plan your 401k... you know, financial advice like pro atheletes would hire out, just on a much smaller level. Help you know how much you can comfortably afford per month for fun stuff, and how much you must put against debt or into savings, etc.  To me it always seems so simple I think ""who would pay for that"" and yet I see so many questions asked that I think, perhaps it's something that would be useful.

Opinions? Even if this isn't something I try to do online, would this be something even worth pursuing as a side gig considering your customer often would be too broke to easily pay for such a service... On one hand I like making extra money in side gigs, and on top of that, I like helping people escape the slavery of perpetual debt.

t3_bh390m,"How much to let off when on steps 4,5,6?","I am a planner,  and probably way over analyze things but wanted to get advice anyway.  

I am in my mid 30’s and have been deeply in debt relative to my income really since 18.  I have made a lot of progress and am making rapid progress on paying off debt.  I have realized that with debt and interest I’m basically a slave to the bank and student loans,  it will take 30-40 years to break out on minimum payments.  

I am on step 2 of the baby steps and  will have all debt except house paid  off in 2 years from now.    Once I am done with paying off all my debts and then fully fund my emergency fund,  I will need to start saving about $1100 a month towards retirement (15%).  After I start saving for college for 4 kids, and pay at least enough on my house to pay it off In 15 years,  there won’t really be a whole lot left over.  It seems like I am trading what I pay onto debt to pay for steps 4,5,6 and don’t get to have any fun with money.  

 If I wait until my house is paid off before I can really enjoy money,  my kids will be grown and gone and I won’t be able to do fun things with them while they are kids.  

I want to be able to buy a used but good condition camper,  and travel/camp with kids.  I want to be able to take them on some trips, Disneyland, cruise, etc. 

Having a couple hundred dollars a month extra will make trips, campers, 4 wheelers, etc, very difficult and slow to do.

I also wanted to buy some rentals at some point.


I know I’m only on step 2, and have probably 3 years until I even enter step 4,  but when I look that far ahead,  and see how much retirement savings and college will be,  I almost feel more hopeless than the debt was making me feel.

It is probably the depression talking,  but with my weight, and family history,  I don’t have a lot of hope that I will have a terribly long life expectancy,  and I don’t want to spend my whole life working towards something I will never get to see into fruition.  I want to provide for my wife,  and get my kids a good start and an inheritance that will hopefully help them be better off than me.  But I believe that this life is all there is,  and it makes me sad and tearful to look to my future and feel like even with me trying so hard and giving up so much to get out of debt,  I’m never going to be able to “live like no one else”.

t3_bh32d9,Rewards debit cards?,I remember when I first got a debit card they use offer all kinds of rewards for using them. Then one day is like it all stopped. I want to get rid of my credit card but getting $100 cash back checks in the mail every few months is nice. I pay off the card each month so there is no interest but I want to get rid of it out of principle. What happened to rewards on debit cards? Are there any banks that still offer rewards?,0

Why wouldn’t the suggestion be to have the 3-6 months emergency fund before tackling your debt?  Seems like FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) would cause one to be more cautious and make sure you have a nest egg. If you spend every dollar paying off debt and something happens, such as a job loss, you would have nothing and would have to beg/steal/borrow/charge your way out of it. Again, if anyone has heard/seen him explain this I’d love to hear the rationale. If someone has a link that would be even awesomer! LoL! Of course it’s a word!",0

t3_bgx1yq,Chicagoland Advise,"Hey all!

Dave Ramsey fan here. My wife and I have been living near STL and working our every dollar budget. There's a big chance we'll be moving to Chicago, near O'Hare. I have an opportunity to work at a great company in Niles. It would be a long-term, permanent position.

I have zero experience with Chicago and would love advice from those familiar with the area - Where should we look for a rental? How much should we expect to pay? Currently, we have 2bd 2ba 1000sqft for 1k/mo. We're not opposed to downsizing (in price and space) to save extra money towards a house! But I also don't want to end up in a very sketchy neighborhood, either.

Once we move, I expect to make about 75k initially, plus another 10k or so when my wife finds a job as well.

Would love any advice Chicagolanders have to offer!

t3_bgvw71,Student loan/increasing snowball,"My student loans are serviced through 2 companies - Great Lakes and Navient. Each account is comprised of several individual loans. My understanding is that I should list out each loan individually and attack them smallest to largest. 

My concern is this - the main benefit of the debt snowball is that you get the consistent motivation of paying off smaller loans and seeing your snowball amount grow larger with each one, thereby accelerating the process and providing more motivation.

My loans are currently in deferment, so I’m counting the minimum payment as the accruing interest. If I list those out individually, I have 9 loans totaling about $20k to pay off before I even get to my first credit card. And while paying those off IS progress and moving me in the right direction, my snowball won’t be growing larger with each one and I’m looking at a really long slog right off the bat. 

However the 10th item in my “smallest to largest” list is a credit card with 29.99% interest. Paying that off first would be a smaller, more motivating win, AND would free up about $150/month more for my snowball by losing that minimum payment AND would save me a ton in interest.

So do I:

1) group the student loans together and move them towards the end of the list so I can focus on paying off the debts that will help accelerate this process, or 

2) stick with the rule to list each loan out individually and work smallest to largest?",0

I only asked very limited questions not related to this (she did have an accident prior to this she is trying to settle for). So, I believe this is now her rock bottom. Not sure if this will be a felony or a misdemeanor. Time will tell, her case is not till 5/2. So I assume I will read about it either in the paper or off the docket by the end of the week.

On good nights I can make up to $25 dollars per hour, and on slower nights I make about $17 per hour! That is actually really good money for a side job. So I thought I would make this post to share with you that if you did that 5 days a week for 4 hours each day, you could make around $1,500 of extra money.

We got married in November and combined we currently have ~$44,000 in consumer debt and ~$210,000 in student loans. Yeah, we’ve made some dumb fucking mistakes and now here we are. My credit score is around 680 and my husband’s is around 650; they are climbing though.   
  
We are sick of the debt and are both committed to working hard to gain control of our financial situation. We have our emergency fund and we sat down last night and prepared to start BS2 with the cash envelope system when we both get paid next week. I understand Dave’s approaches (I think)... but what about those of us who have so much debt that there’s no way we can get it paid off in a manageable number of years? Do you just live off rice and beans for 10+ years and hope you make it to enjoy some semblance of balance on the other side? Also—we’re not certain we want children, but I don’t want to wait until 35 years old to pop out our first child because we’ve finallyyyyy finished paying off the debt. I barely have energy now! But I also don’t want to be raising a child in a cramped apartment.  
  
We’re currently renting a 2/2 apartment close to my office. Our rent, while very cheap for the area, is still $2,100/mo. The lease ends in October. (We have to have 2 bedrooms because we both frequently work from home and need an office.) We’re butting heads over the idea of saving up to buy a house and moving to the suburbs, which are booming (so we could likely make some money in a few years). We could rent in an area further out, but the rent there is only ~$500 less per month. My husband feels it’s ridiculous to be throwing this much money towards rent when we could theoretically get a mortgage for half of what we currently pay. He has suggested sticking to a strict house budget of $200,000 and looking only for a starter home—nothing fancy or big. This would free up another ~$1,000/mo to put towards debt and would also mean we’re in the suburbs where groceries/utilities/etc are cheaper. Is this just a terrible idea? Is our situation weird enough to warrant considering this? I know what Dave would do, but I don’t know what is actually practical.

t3_bg6wh9,"Starting to get call backs from second jobs, incredibly excited!","My apologies if this turns into a wall of text!

For starters, i'm 27, not married, no kids, but am in debt and tired of having payments!

I'm an insurance agent by day, with some student loans and a personal loan I've been kicking down the road. My SO is currently in college, finishing her degree to become a teacher which is her lifelong dream. I have a finance degree, consider myself great with money, and my SO looks to me to make the financial decision making. I'm *okay with money* at best. It's not that I don't understand money, or how the system works, it's simply about doing the activity you know is right.

Upon finding Dave Ramsey I decided becoming debt free should be my number 1 goal. I make okay money, but have student loans, and a personal loan from my college CC debt I rolled into a loan a year or so ago. I've just been paying minimums on everything, including my car loan. My SO has another \~18 months at university before she graduates, and my goal is to be debt free at her college graduation.

I've started by making a dent in the loan by selling things I own but never use, including most of my very large video game collection, vintage clothing/jersey's, sports collectibles, and misc. stuff around my apartment. I also run a small business repairing and selling video game consoles (due to my collection and ability to fix most consoles). This has been good side money, but not quite where I want to be.

Today I got a phone call from a local pizza joint. I had applied to be a driver this morning (I was hoping I was qualified despite never working in food delivery before). I've honestly never been so excited about getting a part time job. I have a hybrid Lexus hatchback I absolutely love to drive, that gets \~45MPG, so when considering part time jobs I thought this would be perfect.

So I made the huge mistake of signing up for a timeshare before I found Dave. I've heard him advertise the Time Share Exit Team. I met with them yesterday for a free consultation.  They advertise that you will pay for the services but if they can't get you out of the timeshare, you get a full refund. I liked the sound of it but didn't want to jump in without doing my research. 
Each case is different depending on your situation. I have a mortgage of $9572.59 at the current time. I'm paying the minimum in it although it's in my snowball. They will charge $6395 for their services and they state the settlement typically includes a settlement fee to the timeshare of 10-15% of your mortgage to get you out. 
One concern in the contract is the wording ""reasonable"". If I get a settlement offer that they think is reasonable and I don't agree, there's no refund. Also, the money back guarantee also stated within a reasonable amount of time, a minimum of 18 months. I was still thinking this is the price I have to pay for this mistake. 
Last night I was looking up reviews of Time Share Exit Team and saw a lot of bad reviews. People who say they've paid all this money and it's been 3 years and they won't refund the money although they've not been able to get them out of the contract. After seeing all of the bad reviews, I'm thinking maybe I should just try my own negotiating with the timeshare.

I’ve been using the snowball method in order to pay this debt down. 

I have 3 more paychecks left, which are usually around $2100. I’m trying to decide if I should continue to throw everything towards the debt I have or keep the paychecks in my checking account in order to be able to have some money for expenses once I return home (rent, groceries, etc).

41 and 46 years old. 4 kids. Living in California.

Take home pay: $9600

Mortgage Payment: $2071 (21% of take home pay)

Emergency Fund: $190

Consumer Debt: $173K 
Mortgage: $290K

Breakdown of Consumer Debt: 
$13K - Credit Cards
$85K - Student Loans 
$15K - IRS Taxes
$28K - RV loan
$28K - truck loan (payment is $630/mth)
$4K - 403b loan

Notes: They are upside down on the RV. They’re okay selling both the RV and the truck. Not investing currently. They also are not sure how to assist in helping their daughter who is in college.

My suggestion:
- I imagine Dave would say to get that $1000 emergency fund this month by selling anything and everything. Immediately call the IRS and set up a payment plan and attack this before they do the debt snowball (minimum payments on all other debts while they’re paying IRS). While that’s happening, sell the truck and RV for as much as possible, and go to their local credit union for a small loan to cover the difference for the upside down RV. Daughter can work while she’s in college. Switch to a community college for a year or two if need be. My hope is that if they get gazelle intense, and can put $4800/mth towards debt of their $9600 take home pay (50%), they can be debt free in 36 months. 

The good news is they have a great income and reasonable mortgage payment. They feel like every time they get something in savings, it gets wiped. I can tell they need encouragement and accountability more than anything. They know they need to reign in spending, especially eating out,  but they are done using the credit cards.

I first heard about Dave a little over 2.5  years ago. My wife and I moved to a different state and I took a job working nights until I found a “real” job doing what I went to school for. It was during this night job a co-worker brought up Dave. Since he seemed to do everything but follow the baby steps I didn’t think much of it. 

 Prior to this I was unemployed for a few months job hunting and we were renting a basement bedroom from family. My wife had a job but our income was minimal. Fortunately, so were our expenses and we had no debt at the time. 

Fast forward a little bit, the car we were driving started having some expensive issues so we bought a new/used car. Within a month we finally got an apartment. My wife continued to work for a few months but then left her job because 1) issues with management and 2) I got a better job that didn’t require her to work to meet our needs and have a little extra. 

It was around this time that I started listening to Dave. I tried to share with my wife but the idea of a budget was not sounding fun. I didn’t push at first because she provided for us for some months before and had more income during our first year of marriage while I finished college. For almost the past two years I have been the primary breadwinner and have tried to include her in the process of making a budget. I even bought FPU and tried to watch some of the lessons with her but nothing stuck. Still, I made a budget and at least tried to keep us from adding to our debt. For the last several months she has been working but it doesn’t pay a lot. Her main compliant is that I don’t let her spend “her”money. In that time we bought a house and our expenses are obviously more than when we were renting.  

She plans to get a better paying job here in the next couple of months but  she wants to be able to spend the money she makes without worrying what I’m going to say but she will still give me money in order to pay bills and buy food. I didn’t say this but in my head I thought “That’s not how this works!”

I’m not perfect in all this. My frustration at times has been described as condescending and I own up to that. But I feel like I’m making every sacrifice I can so we can get out of debt but she isn’t willing to stick to some kind of plan. 

How have you gotten your spouse on board with the baby steps/Total Money Makeover? Have you tried working the plan on your own with any success and wait for them to come around?

Note: I’m sure some people will have their opinion of our marriage. I understand that money is a big part of marriage but we generally get along well and make a great team. We have had some bumps in the road during almost 4 years being married but mostly that is due to family (mine and hers). Additionally, we have taken in her two younger brothers (20 &amp; 17) over the past 18 months because my MIL and FIL are literally the worst parents",0
t3_bfvinl,Quitting,So today I saw my schedule for the hours of my job. Then I saw that I had 15 per week for a month and a half now. Then I was thinking of quitting . Then the manager came up and told me if I wanted more hours and said yes . So he told me that in order to get more hours I should stay to midnight working . Then I said to him I think about it . Then I gave a thought then I remembered that I have summer classes for college at 8 in the morning so I made my decision that I am still going to quit . But the thing is that if I did the right thing . But I am going to put my two week notice.(This is for the summer after High school ),0
t3_bfotyt,Everyday Millionaires question,"I was listening to Dave’s most recent everyday millionaire show and it occurred to me that he needs to ask an additional question; 

Is your net worth total yours alone or in addition to your spouse? And what’s the breakdown, earnings retirement funds etc..

Does he ask this and I’m missing it? This is quite an important detail because accumulating wealth with two earners is different than doing it alone. I’d like to know the breakdown when he takes these calls on the show.",0
t3_bfo0t1,Is Dave’s Foundations in Personal Finance curriculum 100% secular?,"I recently learned of an opportunity to teach a group of at-risk teenagers about personal finance this fall through a local public school (via an after school program).  I would love to use Dave’s principles and specifically his Foundations curriculum for this, but I’m a bit nervous that there might be religious undertones to the curriculum, which I don’t think would be good to use in the public school setting that I would be involved in.

If anyone has any insight on this, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",0
t3_bfszan,Question about the funds to invest in form my estimated retirement age,"I am not at the investment stage of the baby steps...however I am simply trying to better understand where I need to put my head at when I do. 

I currently have two 401ks with previous companies (in fidliety and john hancock)...and a Roth IRA in American Funds. The issue with all 3 of these are the fees involved.  

Recommendations over at personalfinance is to look at transferring into Vanguard or Schwab.  I did some digging and maybe I am not in the right place...but I thought Dave recommends funds that outperform the S&amp;P 500.  When I look at the 10 year records...they appear to be below the S&amp;P 500. 


Index 2045 https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/investment_help/investment_research/mutual_fund_research/mutual_funds.html?path=%2fProspect%2fResearch%2fmutualfunds%2fsummary.asp%3fsymbol%3dSWMRX

Same here:

Vanguard 2045

https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vtivx

So guess I am confused as to the type of funds Dave recommends that do outperform the S&amp;P500.  I also assumed you don't necessarily want to go with the Index funds because when the market does bad...so do your results.

t3_bfmju1,Consolidating debt?,"Dave writes it's a stupid move, because you are simply transferring debt. However, I come from a country with some ridiculous inflation but have moved to another country so my income is paid in a different currency meaning the inflation on my debt from my home country is simply added interest.

When I finish school I want to consolidate the debt in the new country as I would get better interest. I can't see the arguments against it, but yet Dave recommends against consolidating debt?",0

t3_bfdz6x,Getting Started,"After many (10+) years of being in school/living off of student loans and credit card debt, my husband and I are finally going to live within our means and get our finances in order. While I was in school, we both worked FT and our net income was \~80k. We did not live within our means and supplemented our income with my student loans and credit cards. The saying in my head was ""we work so hard at work/school/being parents, we \*deserve\* this \_\_\_\_\_\_\_,"" and once I graduate and make more money we can pay off everything and afford it all.""

Well, I graduated and our net income is now \~145k (and will grow thanks to degrees!) But right now it feels like we actually make less because a.) we are buried under cc debt, b.) student loans!!!, c.) I was living abstractly to begin with and am currently not using loans/credit cards to perpetuate that cycle.

Over the last 10 years I have also noticed an increase in my consumption of reality-clouding booze. This journey is basically about living in REALITY (and accepting it and yourself as-is) vs. a false perception of reality based on borrowed money; my false perception of reality was easier to accept as truth (read: head in sand) while I was drinking a few glasses of wine every night ;) Over the last 6 months I have basically kicked alcohol's butt (which was priority #1) and now feel equipped to tackle the associated philosophical battle re: living in financial reality. (It's also nice on the budget when you're not drinking it all away!)

In the last 48 hours I have accomplished a lot:

\- I created a (hopefully realistic) monthly budget (I will post that separately because I'd love feedback on my projections for groceries, clothing, etc.

\- I downloaded EveryDollar (and retroactively entered everything for the month of April thus far -- and it's not perfect but hopefully by the end of May it will be -- and I'm proud of myself for not allowing my OCD to sabotage my efforts/make me throw in the towel!)

\- I plotted out all of next months' bills on a paper wall calendar and figured out which paychecks will cover which bills

\- I talked A LOT with husband and we agreed re: frivolous things to cut out of the budget (= reducing our restaurant, carry-out, and fun spending)

\- It looks like by this coming payday (Friday) I will have accomplished BabyStep 1

\- We will pay off the first of our credit cards (it's only $450 but hey, it's a start!) by this Friday as well

Question: How important is it to pay of little (&lt;$200) medical bill debts? I am so much more tempted to pay off the credit cards to get some motivation going!

t3_betcas,I'm debt free!!!,"24 year old single female, living in Vancouver, BC Canada. 

I grew up in extraordinary poverty in Buffalo, NY.. put myself through college and got 3 degrees (game design, computer science, and math) in 4 years. I've always hated debt and took as little as I could, working 20-40 hours a week all through college, but I went to a private school and had no help from parents, so ended up in 40k of debt (federal only) from student loans.

I worked a ton of overtime in both my paid internships, easily 80-100 hour weeks every week, and put everything above rent w/roommates and food into savings to pay for the rest of my semesters cash and paying down my loans early. By the time I graduated, I had about 16k left and moved to Vancouver..

Where low salary (around 50k USD for one of the highest cost of living cities in the world) and burnout made it super hard to make progress on that remaining balance :(

That's when I found Dave Ramsey and got my ass in gear! Moved out of my 1 bedroom into a microsuite (200 square feet of living space, no I'm not joking), and cut out absolutely everything I didn't need to work overtime from home. Worked 75 hour weeks, every week, which was as much as my already battered mental health could take.

Now, less than a year after graduation, I'm debt free! I'm so excited to change my stars and finally leave poverty behind. I grew up homeless and shoplifting from 7-11 to feed me and my little sister, so now looking at getting enough of a buffer in BS3 to never have to risk being there again is like a weird fever dream.. and the fact that I'll be able to afford the $6000+ bill for getting my awful poverty teeth fixed so I don't need dentures by 30 makes me so happy. 

It hasn't sunk in yet really, and I know the Dave part was the tail end of my debt free journey, but I wanted to share my victory with you guys :) I lurk on this sub all the time and want to contribute in case I can motivate someone else to keep pushing through!",0
t3_bf0h79,Why does Dave ban investing more than 15% before the house is paid off?,"As I see it, there are TWO good reasons to invest beyond 15% in a taxable brokerage while paying down the house: 

1) There is a spread between the mortgage interest and the expected returns. 

2) If you lose your income (or otherwise can't pay your mortgage with your income), you can make mortgage payments by selling your investments. Even if you have to take a loss, it'll be an option which will save the house. (I don't think having a smaller principle will save the house if you can't make the remaining payments on time). 

He often addresses why point (1) is not risk-adjusted. I would agree with him that (1) on its own is NOT sufficient reason to prefer investing over paying off the house. 

But taken together, it would seem to me that focusing on that is not the best idea. 

I'm definitely not *against* paying off a mortgage early. But it's not clear that making that your only focus gives the best *risk-adjusted* return or is even the move that minimizes the probability of a foreclosure. 

(FWIW I'm not really intentionally ""doing"" the baby steps since I don't believe in blindly following any radio personality's plan. But I am still willing to learn from it. I've completed steps 1-4. I'm also not Christian and I think he fails to recognize that luck plays a big role in getting rich. He interviews millionaires but never people who did the same thing and failed to become millionaires for reasons beyond their control. :/ He *is* right that using that as an *excuse* is dumb since excuses don't help the situation. But he's wrong when he dismisses that there are *reasons* beyond the individual's control and says that none of the underlying issues should be addressed in Washington. We can't get affordable healthcare without Washington's cooperation imo... I feel I have to say that lest people who look at my profile get the wrong idea about my opinion!)",0
t3_bf4e6p,This is what church hill mortgage gave me. Should I refinance?,"Currently I am paying $787 ... principal is probably ~$350, and the rest goes to taxes and insurance. I currently don't party PMI either. The closing cost is projected to be ~$7,000. So they are giving me loan for 97k. I have about $90k left on my 30 year fixed mortgage.


Principal &amp; Interest: $705.41

Other/Secondary Financing (P &amp; I): $

Homeowners/Hazard Insurance: $98.00

Real Estate Taxes: $143.75

PMI: $0.00

HOA Dues: $

Total Monthly Payment: $947.16

 

The payment is 947.16-780 = 167.16/m higher but pays off in 15 years!  Note, if you chose to keep your current mortgage and pay 167.16/m extra, you wouldn’t payoff your home in 15 years, instead it would take 17 years and 9 months to payout.  That’s a savings of 33 payments x 665.33 = $21,995.99.  This is net savings accounting for the new loan, the closing costs and prepaids. ",0

t3_bf0j3p,What are the fundamental benefits of paying off an interest-free car loan immediately?,"I mentioned to my brother that in I’m going to be paying off the rest of my car which has about 11.5K of an interest free loan.

As time progresses, that money is worth less and less and I’m actually winning by putting off the pay off. 

He suggested that if I really wanted to pay it off and not worry about the monthly contributions to it, I should just put the 11.5k in a another account some where and pay it off monthly from that account. 


I think everyone in this sub is going to tell me to be weird and pay it off immediately since I have the funds but I was just wondering if anyone had thoughts about that inflation factor.

Hi all,

I was redirected here from r/personalfinance 

I am 23 years old and in debt for the past 5 years. I applied for a credit card as soon as I turned 18 and went crazy... I have not tried paying any of it off because I’m an idiot and now my credit score is 530 according to credit karma. I am getting to the point in life where I need a good credit score to be approved for an apartment or a house in a few years. 

My debt:
Chase cc ~ $3000
Target cc ~ $750
Fast cash loan ~ $685.58
VS cc ~ $600

I don’t know anything about paying off debt and working with debt collectors. I’ve done some research and read that I could negotiate the amount? Can anyone elaborate on that and how likely I am to be approved of that?

I also read that after 7 years of it being on your record, it falls off? It’s been 5 years, should I just wait it out? 

I heard there are debt relief services too. Are those legit? Or recommended?

I don’t know where to begin. Debt collectors intimidate me and I am terrible at haggling.. pointers would be great. 

I don’t make much money for living in the Bay Area and I also have school to pay for. I have about $1800 saved in my savings account and $1000 in my checking, plus I’ve got bills that totally ~ $650/mth + ~$1000 per semester at school including books",0

t3_bebr68,Is my mortgage payment too much?,"My wife and I just started the baby steps and we're currently in BS2. In December 2017, we closed on a house. The payments are manageable, but I think they are too high. Our payment is currently 32% of our take home pay with a 30yr fixed mortgage. The house is a 70's ranch, but it sits on 3 acres of beautiful, fenced in yard really close to family. We love the location, but we don't think this is our forever house. I'm pretty hesitant to just stick with it and most likely be house poor for the next 29.5 years. It looks like if we stay and finish BS2, (40k in about 1.5-2yrs) pretty much all the money that went to the debt snowball would go to 15% of retirement. Selling the house would clean up about half of our debt and allow us to save for 3-5 years for a down payment of 20% or more and enable us to have a lower monthly payment on a 15yr fixed mortgage.

Background:
My fiancé and I both live together. I make about $85k/year, and she makes about $40k. I have approximately $23k in private student loans, and she has about $70k in Federal student loans. Neither of us have any other debt. Our rent and all utilities is about $1550/month. We are getting married in 10 months (date &amp; venue are already locked down.)

Based on the information above she could be considered dependent on my income. I was trying to think if it would make sense to get some level of life insurance for her now, just so I would sleep a little easier knowing that she would be ok if something were to happen to me. 

My current thoughts are either getting a policy with the full 10-12 times my salary now, or just getting a smaller policy of approximately $100-150k. The smaller policy would help her pay off all of her debt and have some money to help her move forward.

Are there other - more exciting - things I would rather spend 7k on? of course. But it was a really good reminder to keep being intense even in the later baby steps.

t3_bdwsbq,First month using Dave Ramsey plan to get out of debt,"Hi. This is my first month on the Dave Ramsey plan. Where I'm at:

Stay at home mom who home schools her kids, all teenagers now. I have $65 in credit card debt. My husband brings in enough for us to live on comfortably if I didn't spend it. That's something I've tried to get a handle on more. I have to admit we'd be in better shape financially if it had been left up to just my husband. I'm trying to change my attitude when it comes to spending and money. Finally. If my husband were looking over my shoulder reading this, I'm sure I'd hear a big sigh of relief.

I started writing and indie publishing my books and have done okay. I figured it was the perfect time to try to pay off the debt now that we have extra money coming in. It isn't consistent, but it is good enough to work with as long as I keep writing and putting out more books.

This month is my first month doing the DR plan. I sat down and made a budget, got my $1000 EF fully funded, and paid off my first extra payment on my lowest credit card ($3300) which also happens to be my highest interest rate so win win there. The budgeting sucks and I don't think I'm very good at it. I'll have to work harder next month. Given my royalties due at the moment, I should have that one paid off in two months. I'm firmly in BS 2 now going into my second month.

My main question is: 

If everything has to have a job in the budget, what do you do with the money you had leftover from the budget the previous month? For example, I thought I had everything worked out to take me down to zero, though I admit part of that was in a discretionary fund for the business side of things for a couple of reasons. One, I didn't know how much things would actually cost so I estimated. Two, I didn't want to risk overdrawing my account if my estimates went the other way with my math.

Since the extra income I'm using to pay off debt is inconsistent, I can't guarantee I'll have the same extra amount. As far as the budget is concerned (using EveryDollar for the general budget) it looks like what I didn't spend gets moved over to the next month. So do I just adjust things in the budget the following month so I'm budgeting less with what I now know or do I keep over estimating a little just to be safe? Put the overage in the discretionary fund just in case?

One other piece of the puzzle, I'm mostly doing this on my own which I know isn't per the DR plan, but I have some reasons for doing it this way. I'm working with two different budgets. I have the family budget which comes strictly from my husband's income. It's what we live on. I do a separate budget for the money from my publishing business and that's what I'm using to pay off my credit cards. One reason I'm doing it this way is because at 56, I figure it's time I get a handle on finances. It has never been something I do well. I also would love to know I managed to pay off all my debts from my writing. It gives me a goal to keep writing and keep publishing.

My main goal is to run my business without using credit cards. I run everything through my business checking with a debit card and paypal. It works well since most of my payments are online anyway. I keep track of all my business expenses and income in a spreadsheet geared for authors which has helped with taxes and figuring out my expenses. So far, I've managed to bootstrap and cash flow my entire indie career. I'm not really at the point yet where I pay myself a salary. I just use the extra money to pay off my CC.

I just really need advice figuring out budgeting a business income and what to do with the money I have leftover for the next month. Advice on saving for estimated taxes would be nice. That really hurt this first month because I had them figured out with one tax rate and then found out I had to figure them with my husband's tax rate which nearly tripled the estimated taxes I had to pay this month. 

This month was probably not the best month to start a financial plan to get out of debt since it was also the first month I had to pay estimated taxes and stuff, but I'm really happy with what I managed to accomplish in the first month. It gives me hope it won't take long to pay off the credit card debt.

Sorry this was so long. Thank you in advance for any and all advice.",0
t3_bdtsak,Information on possible free education.,"First time post.  Love Dave, been listening a while. In BS2 at the moment but it's on hold due to legal emergency. :(

I wanted to share something with you since I couldn't find any information on it in the searching.

I live in Indiana. Here, we have a program called the Work Force Ready Grant.  In it, if you haven't already finished college, you can get a free education.  Most of them aren't degrees but rather educational certificates similar to vocational schools and they have job placement assistance.

 [https://www.in.gov/che/4773.htm](https://www.in.gov/che/4773.htm) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have also found that there are 20 other states that have similar programs.  Rather than going after a worthless degree, here's an avenue to get vocational training in a career that could potentially set you on a better path.  Especially if you are working a minimum wage job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll warn everyone though, read the terms and conditions and choose carefully.  I would see if I could job shadow someone in the field I was interested in for a day.  I'd also look at the average salary.  Pharmacy tech for instance is on the indiana list but you'll make more at most retail chains, amazon... most other entry level positions depending on the state... just starting out as a tech.  (I am one so if you're interested, I can point you down a path to help boost that income, but not one I would recommend).

&amp;#x200B;

Do your research and see if your state has a grant program similar to this.

&amp;#x200B;

 [https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2018-02-01/these-states-offer-tuition-free-college-programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2018-02-01/these-states-offer-tuition-free-college-programs) 

I found this article talking about 17 programs. I saw another from CNBC yesterday with 20... I would check the requirements and even if you have to maintain residence for 6 months in the state to become a state citizen, it's worth it in my opinion.

t3_be0wvi,Channel Your Inner Dave At Me!,"I am 3 semesters away from getting my bachelor's degree in biochemistry. Most of what I have left are labs, but I became pregnant halfway through my organic chemistry II lab, and had to withdraw due to carcinogenic/teratogenic nature of some of the chemicals we were working with. The school allowed me to complete another semester after this anyway, since I had straight A's in my lectures that semester, but I can't go any further until I complete this lab (bottlenecked).

Since having my baby, we moved to a different state because my mom is providing free childcare while my husband and I both work full time. There are no universities in the town we live that offer my degree, plus we recently found out we are expecting our second baby AND we just started listening to Dave who wouldn't want us to go into debt to finish my degree. We are on BS2, here is the breakdown of our debt:

Student loans: $75k (about 50/50 mine/my husband's)
Car loan: $8k
Medical Bills: $12k
Credit Card: $2k

Our combined income is about $60k, but I'm hoping to get a department transfer soon that'll take us up to about $75k combined. 

I am feeling really hopeless about the amount of debt we are in. We have managed to keep our living expenses really low and are doing everything we can to increase or incomes. 

I am feeling confused/frustrated because if I completed my degree and went into research my income alone would jump to between $70k to $90k based on the jobs available in our hometown. Could be more if we moved elsewhere. Combined we would be at $110k to $130k. It is going to take about $15k more to complete my degree and 1.5 years.

What should we do at this point? What would Dave say?

Edit: CRUCIAL INFO MISSING! If we move back to my college town, our combined income will likely drop to around $45k because the minimum wage in that state is SIGNIFICANTLY lower and impacts both of our current careers. It’s possible it wouldn’t drop that much, but that is our expectation.

What do you have for advice? I know that owning rental properties is the thing that I am supposed to do with my life. How should I be balancing this? What would you do if you were in my shoes?",0

t3_bdcdes,Wavering Gazelle Intensity.,"Hey Guys and Girls,

I'm in BS2 and i'm down from 7 to 2 debts, however, these last 2 debts are the biggest and obviously its taking longer to pay them off,  i can see the dropping balance but I have lost some of the intensity because i'm not dropping debts left right and center like before.

What do You do to keep that intensity?

What tips and tricks do You use to keep yourself motivated?

t3_bd83bm,Deciding to close the first credit card I ever had... why does this feel so hard?,"My sister introduced me to the DR + YNAB lifestyle about 2 years ago. I've been faithfully  about it for the last 1.5yr and I am super grateful! This last December I made a commitment to be a badass gazelle and have been using cash only, with the exception of a few regular online payments through the debit card. Using my cash envelope system I've been more disciplined than ever about spending money, even though I was already pretty frugal to begin with.   


A bit of background, 29 years old with a stable income of $35k/yr and includes full benefits and generous vacation time. I have 3 credit cards and only one left with a balance of $3,500. I know Dave is not about CC, and I have a line of credit for this card that is $8k, but it has an annual fee of $90. It's the first credit card I opened years ago, and was motivated by the points and united mileage airport club perks. Those perks don't benefit me anymore because you don't get the same amount of miles/spending anymore, it doesn't even stretch to get gift cards out of it. I feel that I should cancel it because that is the end goal...eventually, especially since I'm going to be sticking to the cash only for a longgg time.   


Is it bad to not have any credit cards? I may keep the other two just because they have no fees. What if something major happens and I need access to more money than my current emergency fund ($1,500)... I currently have a healthy credit score (750) and only $3k left in student loans.

t3_bd9ayq,Understanding the Roth IRA vs. Savings Account,"As of this weekend, my wife and I are debt free besides our mortgage. It feels amazing to have everything paid off and be done with BS2 but I am also done with BS3 as I have a large savings account that is more than 3 - 6 months of emergency funds. I only recently started listening to Dave Ramsey and I finally followed his message and just killed the debts that I had by paying out of my saving account. The remainder is still a healthy amount. 

I’m about to start applying 15% of our income towards our retirement, but am very curious as to why I would put 15% into a Roth IRA with Fidelity vs. making 2% interest on the money sitting in my Capital One savings account. 

Keep in mind, I’m only talking about putting 15% into the Roth, not investing the money in anything whatsoever ... am I missing something? Why can’t my savings account be my retirement account? Do I gain something by doing the Roth IRA? Obviously, they are both post tax so I just can’t wrap my head around it.

t3_bd7zae,I’m at BS2. Should I go to a $3300 seminary program before I start grad school?,"Hey folks. I’m starting a PhD program this fall. I’ll have a 30k/yr stipend.  I currently work full time, making decent money in California. I have 25k in savings. I have 12k left on my car. That’s the only debt I have. 

Its been my dream to go to this particular summer seminary program for years but couldn’t because I’ve been a students for all my life (besides the past year and a half). I would quit my job in late June and go to this summer seminary program. Tuition is $3300 + airfare to destination ($700). This would be the only opportunity to learn these particular topics covered in seminary. I’ll be getting married and busy with the PhD for the next 5 years. 

Do you think this would be a poor financial decision to commit to that? I can pay the $3300 with my current salary in the next couple of months. 

I can also pay off my car with my current savings. But that leaves 12.5k for moving expenses and to pay for a wedding dress. 

I’m not sure if I should just be saving money because my income will be so low in grad school or since I’m still young and I have the opportunity, I should jump the gun and pursue this dream program.

t3_bcx3uj,BS4: Dave recommends investing 15% gross; how does it work with a Roth IRA?,"My company does a 401K match up to 5%.

Since a Roth is an after-tax investment, do I invest $10,000 per year (10% of gross) or 10% of after-taxes income we see in our paychecks? I’m guessing it’s the former, but just checking.

Edit: I’m in BS3 with about $4K to go left to go on the fully funded emergency fund. Hoping to figure out how to allocate he 15% prior to the first check on BS4.",0

&amp;#x200B;

Just watched this clip. I get why Dave says to pay off the debt first. I get that its part of his teachings. He mentions in the video something about a Beta in the equation. Can someone explain exactly how the equation works as to why I would actually have more money if I paid the debt off first rather than keep investing? Every calculator I find shows I would make a lot more on interest from investing than the interest I'd save by paying it off quick. I'm on pace to knock out my debt in 2 years while maxing out my IRA at the same time. I'd like to get it paid off within 1 year so I can move out sooner, but I don't want to miss out on tens of thousands of dollars that the money could make if I invested it.",0
t3_bcxbak,PSLF v. Full Monthly Payment Advice Requested,"I need help deciding what is best long term. I'd like to weigh what is best financially long term and what feels good now. 

Background: $86,000 (ish) in principle with 5.5-6% interest. 

If I pay it off in 10 years, I'll be paying roughly $1,000 a month. 

I likely qualify for Public Service Forgiveness (I just got a job as a public defender. $51k. I would make payments of roughly $250 a month for 10 years). However, I don't necessarily know if I'll want to stay in this position for 10 years. All the while my interest rate is increasing my total repayment. 

I currently own my home, payments are $430 a month. My car will be payed off in 18 months, currently paying $350 a month. Meaning, I dont really NEED credit right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Indignantly, I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE THEM MORE MONEY IN INTEREST. Yes, $250 a month sounds much better than $1,000 a month but I hate the idea of giving them more in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, my expenses are low so I could pay $1,000 a month however my savings, emergency fund, etc. would take a huge hit. Basically, nothing extra after bills.

After studying for the bar for a few months my credit card debt is $6,000 (currently working on cutting that down asap) and my savings are $2000.

t3_bcth0w,Snowball as motivation? (or) The Motivation Refractory Period.,"TL;DR at the end:  


So, having read all of his books, taken FPU, and having watched a large percentage of his YouTube videos (As well as listening to his show every evening), I well know that Dave promotes the debt snowball as the ""best way"" to get out of debt (not the most efficient, nor the mathematically sound) as it plays towards the psychology of the win. One feels like they make progress if they have wins every so often by knocking out small accounts. This is supposed to help keep motivation high.  
Dave hopes that by the time the larger balances are tackled, one will be more disciplined and can grind through the long periods between wins that a large debt will entail.  


But why do it that way, if one wants to consider psychology?  
One can go for the psychology of the win as well as hit higher interest debt. And can do it in several ways depending on their circumstances.  


For instance, say you have a bunch of debt accounts, ranging from small ones to a few really massive ones.  
There usually is a  Pareto distribution of debt size, where there are more smaller balances than large balances. (Of course this assumes that one has a decent number of accounts.)  


Say that you have enough funds each month to knock out a small balance debt... this means that early on you will be taking out debt at a cadence of one account a month. But soon things slow down and you are taking out an account every 2 months, then three, then 5 etc. (Note that this applies even if you snowball the payments of the smaller balances... the math works out the same)  
So, why not time your attack so that you interleave hitting the large balances (or high interest) one month, then winning on another month by taking out a small balance account... rinse and repeat?  


It is well known that people have what I like to call a ""motivation refractory period"" (MRP) where they can maintain the ""grind"" before needing a ""win"" to re-motivate them.  
Some people's MRP is a month... they need a win every month or they suffer.  
Some people can grit it out for 2-3 months before they need a win.  


Also note that MRP can be strengthened with practice.  


So, if one has an MRP of 3 months, that means one can grind the large debt (or the high interest debt) for 2-3 months before hitting their small debt for the win.  


In other words, for motivation it may make sense to time the small balances to help maintain motivation rather than front-loading all the wins early on.  


A simple way to do this might be:  


* List all your debt smallest to largest.
* Estimate how long it will take you to pay off the debt
* Estimate your MRP
* Scatter your small balance accounts at strategic points to maintain motivation

&amp;#x200B;

Or even simpler:

* Keep small debts in a ""Quick win pool""
* Hit large balances (or high interest debt)
* If one feels their motivation waning, take out one of the debts from the quick win pool
* Go back to hitting larger debt (or higher interest debts)  


Granted, Dave's plan is simple to follow, and is a plan that anyone can follow as a starting place. But if one is to argue the psychology of the win over the math, then why not optimize the win if you won't optimize the math?  


TL;DR  
Why not structure your debt payoff order so that you are guaranteed a psychological ""win"" every couple months (or however long an individual's motivation lasts) rather than front-loading all the small debts early on? The hardest part for many people (reading all the comments) is the ""grind"" at the end of the snowball where you are plugging away at large balances for a long time without the feeling of winning by closing accounts.",0

Time for me to take a moment to pat myself on the back in front of a bunch of internet strangers! I also want to share a few tips on how the mess got created, and how I got out. I hope my story will serve as inspiration for someone who is staring down a mountain of debt. I’d love to know that I made an impact in motivating someone else’s journey.

**TL;DR: Got married, weren’t on the same page about spending, got divorced, payed off $51k of debt in 3.5 years by myself.**

The Numbers:

Went through a divorce 3.5 years ago, and as part of our agreement I took on our debt, which totaled just over $51,000. Salary wise I was in the range of 100k.

The Mess:

The bulk of this debt was accrued on credit cards during our marriage. We essentially lived a lifestyle well above our means. We were fairly frugal on things like trips (drive instead of fly, share lodging with family, for example), and the only vehicle we purchased during our marriage was a 2-year old, well-kept, dependable vehicle we got a good deal on. No toys like motorcycles, or RV’s. 

One big failure on our part: we started with separate bank accounts for several years before I finally convinced her we should put the accounts together and make it “our” money instead. By that point, the bad habits were ingrained and we’d already racked up about 30k in debt. 

Our main problem was day-to-day spending. We ate out way more than a family of four should. As for spending, I originally put the primary blame on the ex, which is technically true: I was the natural saver, and she spent money like the bank was on fire. Weekly trips to “wander around Target”. Daily boxes arriving from Amazon, Nordstom, and the Loft. The UPS guy just about wore a path across our lawn. Weekend girl’s trips to the outlet mall. She never met a sale she didn’t like. 

But the reality is we were both to blame. It wasn’t “her” spending, it was “our” spending and I didn’t treat it as such. By the time I started listening to Dave and tried to get her on board the bad habits were just too much a part of her. She couldn’t/wouldn’t see the light about reducing our spending. This was a relationship problem, and we admittedly failed in that respect. There were other issues, but never being able to get her on the same page about money was a major factor in our decision to eventually divorce.

The Cleanup:

So, once the divorce was complete and I was saddled with the debt I admittedly took on a “Dave-ish” approach. I only got gazelle-intense in the past year as the end started to appear on the horizon, but the whole time my primary focus was to eliminate that debt. While I don’t follow Dave’s plan as passionately as some do, the one thing I wholeheartedly agree on is to treat debt like cancer. Cut it out of your life, as if your life depended on it. As a newly “free” man, I realized I wasn’t truly free as long as I was sending a huge chunk of my salary to the banks each month.

So my “ish” method included trimming the fat, paying extra towards the debt snowball, and not contributing to voluntary saving opportunities. I eliminated most pleasure spending, but did leave some room for dating. I was a newly-free bachelor, after all. 

The one area I did take some liberty with was summer vacations over these past three years. Did these trips set me back on my debt-free strategy? No question. My reasoning is that my kids are only young once, and I would not pass on the opportunity to make awesome summer memories with them while we had the chance. My oldest will be off to college next spring, and I’m thankful we’ve been able to travel and enjoy life before he takes off to make his own way in the world. I can live with the trade off that it took me a little longer to be debt-free, because I’ll have those incredible memories forever.

Anyway, every spare bit of cash I could find was thrown at the debt. Selling stuff, doing some consulting on the side, and every bonus check each year went straight into the credit cards. I chipped away every month, and finally today I made the last payment to take all those balances down to ZERO. Phew! Eliminating debt really does feel like beating cancer. I suddenly feel like I am reborn, with every opportunity imaginable waiting ahead of me. Now on to steps 3-6…!

I would advise anyone not to repeat the mistake I made which led to this mess being created in the first place.

**Get with your partner on the same page about money. Today. Right this MINUTE.** We had many long talks about our relationship goals while dating, and were pretty much on the same page in all aspects… except the money thing. We never addressed it up front and it helped kill our marriage in the end. Be on the same page with your fiancée/spouse as soon as possible when it comes to money. This was our primary breakdown. Combine your bank accounts after marriage, don’t think you can operate separately and be successful. Have “the talk”, don’t wait to find out when it’s too late.",0

Starting this year, I started putting ~$1,000 (a little more some months) into my savings “just In case my car breaks down”. I plan to get and pay in cash for a reliable car that I can drive confidently.

$1,000 baby emergency fund from BS1

$4,525 of saving for a car, as of this month.

t3_bc4e79,"Follow Up Question to ""Career Related Question""","HI DR FAM!!

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago I made this post on the same subreddit ""[Career Related Question](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaveRamsey/comments/b2jegn/career_related_question/)""  and got really good advice from you all.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received my offer letter today from my new company and need guidance. I thought my offer was going to be 200k; however, due to budget limitations, the offer was revised to a base salary of $175k and a guaranteed a bonus of $17,50 (10%) at the end of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to have to relocate to a different state as well. The company stated that they would help with relocation expenses as part of the compensation package.

&amp;#x200B;

I would have to either sell my condo or rent it out. I know Dave state to sell it, but my parents are in the real statement management business and offered to help manage it while I am away. The mortgage/HOA would be considerably less than the 25% of take-home pay that Dave mandates.

&amp;#x200B;

The COL in the new area is significantly lower than where I am currently living.

&amp;#x200B;

Actual Questions:

I have twoquestions that I would need to figure out:

&amp;#x200B;

Question One:

I would have to repay a sign on bonus to the tune of $15k. If I accept the job now, I would only have about 4k saved (as I am in Baby Step 2) and would have to take out a personal loan to cover the difference. The thought of taking out a loan freaks me out after I have just closed out all of my credit cards.

&amp;#x200B;

Question Two:

I have a love/hate relationship with my boss. The work environment is toxic. My boss has been forced to take leave for a month so they can take care of their mental health. Part of me feels guilty for even thinking about leaving but the other part of me is done with the drama. I don't think that the month off would help my bosses deep seeded issues.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts?

It was way beyond our scope so we had to call an electrician. Soooo thankful for Dave Ramsey as we took our emergency fund and our extra paycheck and paid cash to the electrician. No stress.

* Free breakfast at the hotel &amp; I have already talked about going to a grocery store when we get in

t3_bbcac9,"Little family problem, is there anything I could do?","Okay so this actually isn't about me, it's about a family situation and I would really appreciate some advice :)

Quick note, I'm not from the US so some things may work a little different and incomes/costs will also be very different.

I'm currently 19 years living with my family going to college for a Financial Engineering degree, I don't work or have any way of income myself. My family's household income is around 80k a year, which is very good for my country actually, however around 30% of that goes to taxes so that leaves it at around 55k. My dad is the one who has the larger salary. 

I'm going to say some of our biggest expenses yearly. We don't own any houses, we rent two houses (a house and an apartment) as my dad lives out of state due to work. Combined both are around 12.5k a year. My dad is also paying my college, which is around 10.5k a year, my sister is still in high school and that's around 3.5k a year. I believe a couple of years ago my parent got like a life insurance, I'm really not sure what it is but it's around 4k a year. We have two cars, one for me and one for my mom, both are a little old (2006 and 2008) but fully payed of. This is from what I can remember right now so that leaves us with around 24k left to live and I'm not sure how much of that is spent on us. Also, this may not be 100% accurate as I'm changing the quantities to dollars, but it's around that.

The main problem is that my dad has credit card debt, im not sure exactly how much but I'd say around 25k. I'm also not sure what is he doing to pay it off and I'm a little concerned because of this, I don't how much is left of those 24k after our life expenses, I don't know if he's paying the minimum on the card, I don't know if he's still missing payments, I'm literally blind to this situation I just know the basics.

My parents are actually considering getting out of that life insurance or whatever, it's actually my mom's, we will get around half of the credit card debt and use it to pay it of I believe.

But then again I don't know about the rest, I kinda want to help but I don't know how. I fully trust my dad and I know he's doing his best to pay it off, and in case it gets worse both of our families are really helpful in these situations, so in the long run I'm sure that nothing serious will happen. But as I said not knowing what is happening worries me a little.

Can I do anything to help?
Is pulling that insurance a good idea?
Should I like give advice to my dad or ask him about the situation?
Or just fully trust him?

I've seen him doing moves to cut down some costs in our family, which is good, but I'm just a little confused and I would really appreciate any comments, suggestions about it.

If I missed any important data or you need to know something else just let me know. There may be some spelling mistakes as English is not my first language but I'm here to clarify anything.

Thank you so much!!",0
t3_bb8def,What would Dave tell me to do if I called in?,"**Income**

Cable/internet - 125

**Remaining**

Approx. $460/mo

**Context**

I feel like I'm in a pretty simple situation financially. Rent is the highest monthly payment, but where I live the rents are price gouged because there is a lot of military. I thought it would be a LCOL area because of how rural it is, but it turns out it is actually more expensive than the city I moved here from. I'm locked in the lease until February. I might relocate after the lease is up. I'd like to keep the cable/internet because there are shows my gf and I like to watch for together time. If you know a way to get specific cable channels without having to pay a cable bill I'd like to know. We only watch TLC, Travel Channel, and Mtv. My phone is a pay as you go plan and it is the cheapest I've found and my car insurance is a lot cheaper now. It used to be $150/mo when I lived in the city. Electric used to run me $40/mo, but now I have to pay for natural gas as well but the weather has been getting warmer so that should get less expensive.

t3_bascv6,"How much of the point of ""gazelle mode"" for reducing expenses to fuel bs1-3 and how much of it is for teaching you a lesson?","So due to being young not having much debt, still having some stuff covered by parents and savings from living at home for a bit out of college I was able to get through bs1 and 2 without really doing  a proper ""gazelle mode"" where I went down to ""rice and beans and beans and rice"". Now that I am at bs3 which for me is going to be at least some of 3(b) ( saving down payment for a house). 

Running the numbers I will be done with my 3 month emergency fund( have job with larger company so pretty stable) in 2-3 months. To save up a down payment big enough to get a decent house in 15 year mortgage paying less than 25% of my income it looks like I will need roughly 2.5 years. I played with the numbers a little bit going from 200( which would be pretty rice and beans) a month for food and 60 a month for fun and hobbies to $400 for food( which would be eating much nicer) and 100 a month for fun and hobbies and the difference is over 2 years was only ~$3,000 out of 55k I  would be saving, while the quality of life under the latter would be much better. 

So getting to the core of my question. How much of going down to the rice and beans is for learning the lesson of your errors and how much of it is to reduce expenses? 

Starting from here it seems that if it's mostly for the financial benefit I'd rather go gazzelle mode just until my emergency fund is built-out and then allow myself to spend a little bit more for sake of quality of life since I would be in 3b for 2.5 years. I just feel like I'm almost cheating the plan if I'm not gazzelle mode for much time at all but I both was never in horrible shape to begin with nor was I living too high on the hog to start.

t3_banjja,Buy Home or Stay Renting?,"Hi Steppers! I have a unique situation on my hands. Right now, I've just entered BS2 but have been offered to buy the house I am currently renting. However, being that I'm still getting out of debt I have no down payment saved up. BUT the seller has offered to gift some of their equity... enough to cover a 3.5% down payment and will pay all closing costs.

The amount of debt I have right now is 125k with income of 67k. The property will be approx. $160,000 with an estimated mortgage of $1150 (including PMI). Rent in my area ranges from $1100-1700 a month for the same type of home.

I feel like this would be a good deal but I also know that Dave says to get out of debt before buying a home. I'm conflicted and would like advise if you have any about maybe what you would do in this situation... buy or keep renting? Thanks in advance for any help!",0
t3_bak9za,What’s the problem with leasing a car?,"I’m 100% on board with Ramsey on pretty much everything, I’ve just never seen him give a good answer on why leasing a car is not a good idea mathematically. I understand that the company ultimately needs to make money on the buyer and they design their monthly payments accordingly, but just because a company is making money off of you doesn’t mean that it’s not a good deal for the individual as well. 

Would someone be able to explain this to me?",0
t3_balad9,"New to DR, behind in retirement, any advice?","New to Dave Ramsey and just recently started making good money and would like to hear perspectives on how I should be preparing for retirement.

Mid 30s, male, married, no kids, live in HCOL area, single income. Possible dual income soon with wife around $50k.

Details below based on single income:

Income: 160k base, 32k bonus, net take home (after maxing 401k) is $9k/mo. Bonus paid quarterly.

Assets: 22k @ 2.25% EF, 180k retirement accounts

Liabilities: 10k student loans @ 1.6%

Monthly expenses: $4k

Monthly savings plan: $1k roth, $2k brokerage ETF, $2k cash towards EF

No credit card debt. No mortgage, renting for now. No car payments.

I understand too much cash is bad and once we build EF cash back up to 9-12 months EF, I'll start diverting to other investments.

I'm curious though, what other savings mechanisms am I missing (max $19k 401k, max $12k Roth, invest in ETF, and build cash EF). I feel like I'm missing something and definitely feel behind and would like any advice on how we can better prepare for the future. Thanks in advance.

t3_balmn8,Car loan vs. Credit card- which to pay off?,"I owe about 5,200 on my car. If I make only the minimum payments of 355 (interest rate 2.49), the car will be paid off in a little over one year. I have a credit card with the same balance and a monthly minimum payment of 112 dollars (interest rate 22%). 

If I buckle down hard I could probably get my car paid off in 8 months, which would add 355 dollars to my snowball.

Would I be better off attacking the credit card because of the interest or attacking the car payment to free up 355 a month sooner for my snowball?",0
t3_baj5bj,Talk to me about BS4,"Hi guys,  new to Reddit, newly committed to Dave's program though I have known about it for years, and still on BS2.

I am crunching some numbers for the future baby steps and I just want to make sure I understand this correct.  The 15 percent of your income does not include what your employer contributes right?

&amp;#x200B;

Next June I become Vested (county government employee) and my employer will begin matching the 9 percent I am forced to put in which will put me at 18 percent however if I am understanding things correctly only the 9 percent I put in is counted towards that 15 percent which would mean I would need to put in another 6 percent.  I just want to make sure I am calculating this correctly.

t3_balfdh,Baby Step 2: Term Life Insurance/Stork Mode,"Hi All,

First time poster here. 

Been following Dave's Plan the last few years and made some great strides, but then we hit stork mode and have been saving aggressively instead, so lost some momentum but looking forward to tackling our student loans after our first born is here this month.

Just curious what all of you would think Dave would say to this: 

My wife and I make a total of $105k/yr. We're in our early thirties. We had life insurance through our employers for just 1x our salary, which didn't seem like enough coverage and jobs aren't forever, therefore, I purchased two term life policies through Farmers, one in my name and one if my wife's, for 20-years at $500k. I used Dave's rule of thumb for the calculation: 10-12 times your income and went in on the low end (since we both make a little over 50k each)

Come to find out, this is going to cost us about $60-$70/mo. Since we're young and trying to get though Baby Step 2, I feel like this is going to slow us down a bit. Is my policy too aggressive? Am I paying too much and shop elsewhere? Should I really be doing this? At what age should I add our baby as a rider to the policy (seems strange to add an infant to it)? 

Lastly, just as a side note, I tried to get quotes from Zander too but I already brought my pregnant wife through the ringer getting the health exams/blood drawals done, but she gets woozy from needles, so I called it a day and just went with Farmers.

So again, my questions are: Is my policy too aggressive? Am I paying too much and shop elsewhere? Should I really be doing this? At what age should I add our baby as a rider to the policy (seems strange to add an infant to it)? ",0

t3_b9y80n,Should we sell our house to be debt free?,"Talked to a realtor this week about market comps, and the idea is to sell our house and cash out the equity that has built since we bought in 2012. after paying off the 1st mortgage, HELOC, and truck loan, We would be debt free and have around $40k in the bank.

Our income is a combined gross of $145k/yr, which is ok for the area where we live (Boise, ID). I am hoping to increase that quite a bit over the next 1-2 years. Average home price is near $350k here now.

The thought is that we want to buy a larger, and better built home as our first kid is due in November. By being debt free and renting a cheap apartment for a year, we could save up enough to buy a house that would fit a family of four comfortably - which our current house cannot.

Is this a dumb idea?

t3_b97s5x,"The side hustling is real. Last week sucked, this week is awesome.","Hi Folks. I thought I'd share a few things when it comes to making a side hustle and sometimes pushing the envelope.  


I've learned that you have to have a desire to succeed.  You have to be driven to make things work.  You have to work to get out of your comfort zone. Take opportunities when you see them. Think through things logically.   


I'm an EMT who decided I wanted to go back to school for medicine. I'm finishing my degree. I got debt free along the way and have been able to cash flow the rest of my associates and I'm working on my bachelors degree.  


So I was fixing cars as my side hustle, and found that it was really taking a toll on me trying to schedule school, work, and cars around eachother. I switched to a side hustle of teaching CPR one day a week. That brings in about $200-300 per week.  


Well, I've always been a DIY'r, fix it myself kind of person. My family is in a printer business and some of the print heads are in the thousands. They 'go bad' after so long. Well after investigation of it I think they just need to be cleaned. Using my current classes and organic chemistry I'm pretty sure I have a plan to be able to clean them. Refurbishing heads = possible dough.  


Also there is a solution they use in the printing industry that I decided to reverse engineer for a lab project. Today I succeeded. They cost in the realm of $50-$75 per gallon retail. I can make it for around $15 (shipping not included). Selling this solution may be able to set me some side cash as well. PS: Their trade secret wasn't so secret today.   


I'm so driven right now to try to move out, pay for school and plan for med school that I'm just taking every opportunity I can to try and I'm cash flowing my business at this point. All the new research and development is just getting recycled back into what I'm working on.   


Just wanted to share. Thanks for reading.

What exactly do you include for the BS3?

Is there a general time frame that BS3 should take to complete?",0
t3_b9hvqp,Terrible At This (Long),"Actually more like Baby Step -1.

I (27M) have been aware of Dave and the Baby Steps for 11 years. One would think that since I learned all about this at 16 that I would be debt free and on my way to great things.

Not so. I was debt free until I got married at 20. We lived in the SF Bay Area and rent was out of control. $2000/month for a studio. I worked two full time jobs, she worked two full time jobs, and we still had to skip meals (for days at a time) to pay rent.

Fast forward to now, and we’ve halved our rent by moving away from that real estate disaster. But we’ve added two cars because they don’t make public transportation out here like they do in the Bay, a surprise student loan, and so on. We’re doing a voluntary repossession on her car because there’s just no way we can support the vehicle, we’re upside down on it and can’t get a small loan to make up the difference for a sale to get rid of it, and apparently they don’t just take the things back if you don’t want them. Go figure. 

So now we’re looking at $45,000 of debt. I make $15/hr and she makes 11, both full time. I’d recently gotten a second job that had a small base wage + commission and the average earning potential was up to $25/hr, but I could not get them to play ball with my schedule. They were essentially texting me my schedule the night before or day of, where to be and when to be there. I had let them know I have this other job and I get insurance through them, so I can’t be messing with that one.

For three weeks I was making a training wage of $13/hr, no commission, and nobody could tell me when training would be over. My boss at my main job was getting upset with my unpredictable schedule.

I had to leave that job the other day.  I’d already budgeted April and we were actually going to do okay, but I had to take $900 out of the budget. Now we’re not set to do very well.

I’m trying to get another second job ASAP, but my main job is taking a vote tomorrow on whether or not we should do set schedules. At this time, I can be scheduled to start as early as 7:30am or as late as 7pm. If we don’t get set schedules, I’m not sure how to coordinate a second job, since my schedule would change week to week. 

Has anyone had to work around a rotating schedule for a second job? How did that go? What did you do?

In addition, my wife really, really wants to do these steps, but I think she struggles a bit more than me with the sacrifices. She’s a little older and she wants us to spend more time together, so she resents second jobs, and she gets into that “I deserve” mindset where things start to go downhill. Has anyone had this same issue, and what did you do to help it?

Thanks for listening.

Edit: I don’t plan to leave my current job. I transferred down here and lived in a car for 2 months for the opportunity to work in this location. This location is going to give me the best possible chance to promote into a salary position. I have a positive relationship with the District Manager, my GM, and other GM’s in the company. 

I manage 120 employees and love the industry. My company has grown from 12 to 16 theatres in the last 6 months and I have a great shot at a promotion going forward. I’m not leaving this job for anything short of a job that’s going to pay more than my current job plus a second job.

My initial question was how to work a second job around a rotating schedule. I appreciate that everyone wants to help, but now I’m being accused of not taking responsibility for my current situation and not doing enough to make more money. $15 an hour is GREAT for my position in my industry, given that I have very few marketable skills with enough experience to back them up.",0

t3_b9c79e,Refinance Mortgage to pay off debt while avoid PMI and monthly payment below 25% of THP,"Excuse my ignorance since I am not very financially smart when it comes to mortgages.

So currently my husband and I are in BS2.  We still owe about $47k in student loan debt (have paid off 62k so far in debts, starting in 2016).  We own our home and home values have gone up alot in our neighborhood.  One recently sold for $143k.  We owe around 64K on our mortgage.  I was thinking if we refinanced our mortgage to a 15 year fixed loan (we currently have a 30 year loan AND I'm not actually on it since my husband owned the home before we got married) we could refinance to the 80% mark of the home value to avoid PMI, we would have enough to pay off all our debts.  I also made sure if we refinanced to that 80% mark, the monthly payment would be less than 25% of our take home income.  Also I believe that the interest rate of the mortgage would be less than my current interest rates for my student loans (all sitting around 6%) I have researched this question a few times and didn't really find a good answer.

I am 27 and my spouse 30. We have a combined household income of $120k. We are debt free outside of a home we just bought last year. Our mortgage balance is $120k. We have a FFEF of 7 months of expenses. 

We are currently putting away $18,000 per year away in pre-tax retirement. My company offers a Roth 401k I can start later this year, so we will switch to contributing the full $18,000 into the Roth at that time. 

We are belly aching with two decisions. 

1.  If we stop all investing, strip the budget down to gazelle intensity, we can pay off the house December 2020. Then we can put 100% of my income into the Roth. This is about $38,000 per year after taxes and my insurance and HSA coming out of my pay. 

2. Continue with the Baby Steps and contribute 15% to retirement and pay off the house in 3 years then jack the contributions up to my income.

t3_b93xwc,Advice Needed Regarding Incorporation of Loan Against 403b Plan,"TL:DR - After some mental back and forth without coming up with a real solution, I could use some advice on the best way to approach my overall debt payoff plan, particularly with how I should or shouldn't incorporate paying off a loan against my 403b plan.

**Current debts**:

***Debt Balance - Interest Rate - Monthly Payment***

Mortgage - $179,600 - 3.75% - $1,580

Debt Consolidation Loan (new) - $35,000 - 11.99% - $619 (84 month payoff period, which will be done sooner than that)

Family Loan Payback - $20,145 - 5% - $150 (loan from my brother who helped me buy my first house)

Financed Car - $19,682 - $419

Leased Car - $9,100 - $325

Student Loan - $2,214.29 - 6.25% - $90

**TOTAL MONTHLY MINIMUM**: $3,183

**TOTAL MONTHLY OUTPUT, WITH CURRENT SNOWBALL**: $3,550

Additional debt, currently not included in the ""main"" payoff plan above:

403b Loan -  $19,953.84 - 5.5% - $84.79 paid bi-weekly via paycheck

I stupidly took this loan on my 403b plan when buying my home. At that time, I did not realize that there were only two options with the payments: bi-weekly via paycheck for the length of the loan (15 year loan length, 326 payments remaining) OR pay balance with one lump sum. I chose the longest payoff time-frame of 15 years, thinking I could send extra payments whenever possible. Sadly, that is not the case. \*whomp, whomp\*

This loan basically ties me to my company/job for the next 13.58 years, because I cannot afford to pay both the loan and the taxes that I would incur by leaving my current company and thus my current retirement plan. 

The way I see it, there are 2 options:

1. Pay down all the ""regular"" debt via snowball (current payoff date Sept 2023) and then tackle saving up to pay off the loan with the final snowball
2. Include the loan pay off as part of the current pay off plan

So, what would your approach be? If it's approach #2, how would you go about tracking the payoff time-frame? I've been using [undebt.it](https://undebt.it) and love it, but I can't figure out how to incorporate this loan in the payoff plan... What priority would you give it? How do you account for the bi-weekly payments, the accruing interest, as well as any additional you may be putting aside? How would you determine how much your savings would need to be in order to send that one lump sum?

Is there another approach I'm not thinking of? I welcome all constructive advice!

^(Before anyone gets off track, I realize that basically all of our debt stems from stupid, dumb, idiotic, uninformed mistakes and we should get rid of the financed car and the flease - we'd have to take out another loan just to be able to cover the cost of worth vs value.

My husband and I were married last summer (which is when I started the baby step journey), but he is in an entirely different financial position than I am. He's been working longer, in more lucrative fields, and his parents paid for his grad school entirely. As a result he has no debt and substantial savings.

I'm not too sure,"I want to preface this by saying I think Dave Ramsey is excellent at getting people out of debt. Setting people on the right path. You don't give a debt-aholic more debt tellling them this debt is good but that debt is bad. I get it. 

I no have an issue with debt. I have none currently and other then a house, I'll never have any again. I'm very stable and self employed with a long established healthy business also debt free and economic downturn resistant. I'm also now a saver.

Lets look at buying real estate. I live in California, northern area. Average home 350k to 400k. 

If you put 20% down you don't get pmi, take out a 15 year loan and pay it off. That way. This is Daves way. It will consume a lot of your capitol. 


Or... Save up that 20% and you put 3.5% down the minimum for FHA, keeping that 16.5% in bank as an emergency fund of sorts,  pay down and allow home prices to increase after 2 years make sure you've gained equity, thus utilizing less capita, achieve 20% in equity in that 2 years via appreciation and you paying. Refinance out of that FHA to a conventional. Move out of that house, rent it, allow others to pay off your mortgage. Then repeat the entire process on another home. And if you can afford it (aka able to pay each mortgage yourself if you need to) keep repeating this. 


Now I wouldn't suggest doing this if you couldn't afford both mortgages at the same time. You need to be able to pay both mortgages in case something happens, like 6 months without tenants etc. Worst case scenario. 

However if you can afford this, is there a reason not to do this? Granted property values can drop but historically they don't over time. In the past 30 years, property values have increased 4x in value in California. Most of that just in the past 19 years, due to increasing costs and regulation of new development here.

With my two incomes and my budget living in a small studio alone with my dog, and eating a healthy, not bare-bones diet allows me to put $1500 a month towards that debt putting me at a payoff in about 36 months/3 years.   


I'm excited to have a timeline now but I'm torn between the excitement of my progress and debt free future and the fear that I'm missing out on the important things in life by working so much. I recently ended a 5 month relationship because I wasn't able to give 100% to it as much of my time and energy goes into working and then balancing taking care of my apartment, my dog, and trying to see my family and friends in between. I'm so dead set on getting this financial weight off my shoulders but I fear I'm going to get to that point and find myself at 30 looking back at the last 3 years and wondering if it was worth that kind of sacrifice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hear so many stories of couples ""living like no one else"" and giving up on a lot of socializing to pay off debt but I don't hear many of people going it alone. It feels like a different experience when you don't have a loved one there to live through it with you. Has anyone had any experience with this either on the positive or negative side? Am I going about this too intensely?",0

t3_b7wvqp,Dave Ramsey BS2: Please explain logical reasoning to abandon employer match.,"I’ve listen to a few of Dave’s advice to completely abandon company match to tackle down debt and for simplicity let’s use a scenario where a couple pulls in 80k a year and has employer match of 3%. 

-At that income and marriage status the take home would be 156/month after taxes for a yearly total of $1,872. (22% bracket)

-If contributed to 401k at 3% match you would have $2400 contributed and $2400 matching for a combined total of $4800. 

With these two options, the only way that abandoning the match would make sense is if the market crashed greater than 60%; by which you would have a bigger problem on your hand than blowing your money to a 3% match. 

IMO having an extra $156 a month to pay debt isn’t going to change anyone’s world, while contributing $4800 a year would. After all, I think he said $100 a month/$1200 a year from 25 to 65 at 12% is over a million. In this case it’d be 4.5 million?",0

t3_b7tzhw,Saving for after-baby?,"Hey everybody!

We have been through financial peace (saved my marriage!) we are through baby step 4, and feeling great. We are also trying to start a family. It's very important to me that I am home after having our child, I love my job and hope I can make something work - but those chances are slim. Looking at our budget, I suspect we will fall short about $600 per month if I stop working.

I fully expect to have to find another job/source of income (I'm hoping to watch another child during that time but perfect world situations don't always pan out). Our emergency savings is in a money market currently (better interest), but our bank currently has CDs at even better interest than the money market. We are considering taking some of our emergency savings and locking it away for a year.

The other thought is to open up a new CD every few months to get a better interest rate for the $600-$800 we suspect we will need each month. That way we can mimic our income if we need it, or have that money to start a college savings plan for our kid.

I feel like I might be over complicating this, like theres a better way, or a way that better aligns with FPU. Also, it's worth mentioning that I'm not pregnant yet.

t3_b7o7yx,Bilingual Fans,"Just curious -- I bought the Spanish version of FPU for a coworker whose native language is [obviously] Spanish.

I think/feel that it should appeal ""culturally"" to her/and family more in their mother tongue -- but I'm just guessing.

For anyone who has seen/experienced both -- I know that it is supposedly the same material...What are your thoughts?

**EDIT**

It came in the mail last week. Surprisingly, the actual packaging was lower quality than when I got my FPU kit almost a decade ago. The box was dented. I got curious and opened the package to make sure nothing was damaged. The DVDs were in the case, but not in the individual slots they belonged (doubt that could be coincidence), the CDs were in the correct place. Again, nothing was shrink wrapped (giving an impression that it was not a new kit).

I made copies of the FPU DVDs and will give the coworker the package next week. My wife and I watched a handful of the courses. It is literally about 98% of him translating Dave word-for-word -- except, after 20 years of doing it -- Dave is a FAR superior presenter. There is nothing particularly special about the Spanish version. It is demonstrably inferior -- lower production values, bad translations, smaller, older crowds, and the presenter lacks the charisma and conviction of Dave. It is sad, but understandable I guess.

**UPDATE ON THE FAMILIA**

I wasted my money. The coworker probably won't change anything in the foreseeable future. She is talking about new cars, a newer, bigger home, and her shoe collection is on point -- she's excited she is about to hit 200 pairs!

t3_b7ii8v,Side gig inspiration!,"Hi everyone! Never posted before but felt motivated to share a little bit of our journey. My husband works while I stay home with our two young children. Having me stay home is something we always wanted/planned on, so I left my job as a tenured teacher. The cost of child care would’ve taken most of my salary anyway, and we are happy with this choice. 

However, I have always felt that I can only financially help to a certain extent. I coupon, shop sales, look for deals, etc. but I never truly felt like I was contributing. I never saw myself getting a side gig, because what could I do that wouldn’t take me away for chunks of time??

We started Dave’s plan in January, and I decided that I wasn’t going to passively contribute anymore. I began buying furniture cheap off Facebook marketplace and painting it to resell. After all, I did this with all the furniture in our house, so why couldn’t I make money off of it? Shortly after, a job as a princess impersonator at parties fell into my lap. It’s only a party or two a month, but it brings in about $150-200 extra!

Right now we’re month to month and I’ve wanted to go back to solo living for a while, We just got a new roommate and the landlord said the next time someone moves in we all have to sign a fresh one year lease (understandable) 

Now my issue is the new roommate is a slob, never cleans, fills the sink with dishes, doesn’t follow very basic courteous rules we have (for example no laundry between 11pm and 7am - it’s extremely loud - reason I’m up now is because they’re doing laundry at 2 am) and very annoyingly will tie up the full garbage bag and throw it in the front hall cupboard on top of my shoes and leave it there for days until we nag them. I’ve asked them to stop putting it there, it’s right down the hall to drop it but it’s to much apparently. 

My other roommate (no issues) is planning on moving soon for a career change, and with him going there’s no way I want to be stuck in a year lease with this, problem is all the rent around me is extremely expensive aside from the very widely known bad/sketchy areas. A one bedroom/bachelor runs from 1000-1250 a month, which is more than my 25% take home especially after bills, and right now I pay 550 + bills

We got several quotes for lawn mowing and fertilization service for May to November. We went with a reputable company that gave us a good quote. The cost was going to be $50 a week or $200 a month billed to our credit card. 

On a whim I told my husband to call and see if they’d do a discount for paying in full. It’s a smaller business (6 man operation) and an issue for many small businesses is cashflow. Getting more working capital upfront can be super helpful. 

Not only did they give us a discount for paying in full, they gave us a discount if we paid in cash. $1000 cash for the season. It would have been $1400 if we paid monthly ($200 * 7 months). We still got a signed contract and receipt saying we paid in full for the season. 

Cash is king! ",0
t3_b73l1q,Which thing in which order?,"Hi all! I've listened to Dave for years and now me and my new husband are getting on board with the program but I have some weird situations if somebody could help me think through them that would be great.

We are expecting a baby! Yay!  Our insurance kinda sucks though so we know we will need to have the $7500 total out of pocket ready to pay when baby comes early September. We're on target to have $9000 in savings which would give us some expense money (buying food and other things after baby comes and I'm recovering) and baby supplies. This is our first and our circle of friends and family is a little small so we will probably need that money.

We (mostly me) are behind on our income tax. I was behind and since we married and mine's not caught up he couldn't do his. Dollar wise, this should only be about $2500 or so.

Dave usually says to stop BS2 and fully attack both these situations. Pile up cash for baby and momma. And I've also heard him say pay the IRS first no matter where it falls in the order because they're so nasty to have coming after you. So what should we be doing? Should we split our attentions? We save about $1000/month already and if we can wrangle our food budget and tame it we could save $1500/month potentially. Our total debt is $28,000 and it's all mine. Without baby coming we could be debt free in 14 months or less (gotta calculate the fine print).

Edit 1:

*On buying home and paying it off: buy in a up and coming area that you know is growing, those values will go up. Buy much much much less than you can afford, the deal is to pay this thing OFF and not have a mortgage so then you can invest and save and do whatever. The value will also grow and make you money (you also essentially make money on interest that you are NOT paying so it's lies that you can make WAYYYYY more by investing into the market. I saved 260k of interest, which I will now happily invest over the next 30 years and make 1 million off. There's lots of ways to do this. Get familiar with loan repayment calculators. I checked this every day almost for 10 years to the point I can tell you what your payment would be with any interest rate over any amount of time by sheer estimation. My favorites are these two:*

*For Loans, student loans and I even used this for my mortgage loan payments \*just added tax and PMI etc myself:* [*http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml*](http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml)

*KNOW WHAT ALL THESE NUMBERS CAN DO FOR YOU. plug in different numbers over different years, over different time, over and over and over again. It's fun.*

*FOR investing and compounding interest for retirement, mutual funds etc. I love this one and always check it...all the time.* [*http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound\_interest\_calculator.htm*](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm)

go to grad School done at 23, profession PA: Starting salary 80 at 23 for 2 years, after that went to 90 for another 2 years. During those times I worked every Saturday and Sunday and made an extra 30k.I paid my student loans off during those first 2 years which was 70k. (I lived on about 40k effective lifestyle salary)

Then I started a photography business at 25 and started making about 150-250 total with photography and job for the following 5 years. So at 30 I bought the house. So during those times around 200 on average probably over 5 years. Then photography got oversaturated and I’m only making 30k this year from it and then probably stopping it completely and keeping my part time job only where I make 65-70 now.

So essentially I’ve always had 2 jobs and I have always worked weekends until now really. Since I was about 16 to make that happen. Averaging 60-80 hours per week. Ish. 😑 basically lots of hustling and lots of work doing whatever you are good at and trying to make it happen in whatever way you can. I think extra side business or jobs are the way to go.",0

t3_b6deg5,23 years of age and we just paid off our house!,"It was a surreal day for me and my wife. We paid off our last and only debt, and now we officially OWN our starter home!!! Live like no one else!!

Edit: so after going through these comments I apologize for not giving the whole story-i guess I just didn't want to make a huge long post but here it goes!


I graduated with my Bachelors degree at 20 years of age. My parents didn't have very much money so I payed for most of my degree through college and ended up having about 29k in students loans upon graduation. During my last semester in college I was able to have a job landed with Verizon right after college. In May of 2016 I graduated, June of 2016 I started my position, and then me and my wife got married in September of that same year whew!

Before my wife and I got married we were given the total money make over as a pre-wedding gift from my brother who had recently payed off his debt. My wife and I already had our plans in place before we got married.

We had very cheap rent while paying down student loans thanks to renting from a family friend. By August 2017 we were debt free! And then by February we had completed our fully funded emergency fund. 

We began saving for a good chunk to put as a down payment towards a house, but we weren't really looking yet. 

Throughout the year, we stumbled upon on a fairly inexpensive home in our town for sale. The house was only worth about 40k. We began looking at numbers, planning out for the future and decided to pursue it and see where it went. 

June 2018 we closed on that very house, we got the price down to only 34k! We payed 8k down that we had saved on top of our FF emergency fund. From there we were determined we could do much more and knock this thing out quick. I worked as much OT as I could, worked hard to achieve high bonuses, we cut expenses down to bear minimum. Our minimum payment was pretty low, but we threw whatever extra we could month to month to see that number devrease-some months would $1000 others we would make additional $1500-$2000 payments. 

That brings us to yesterday. We had been saving enough over the last few months and finally reached our pay off amount needed. Just under 14k was left so we payed off the sucker and will be enjoying not seeing those huge payments go out anymore!!

No inheritance money

Parents are not a place themselves to help with our expense

Our house hold income last year was just around 90k.

t3_b6qdkj,Guidance.,"Hi Redditors, 

New to /daveramsey and the baby steps. Planning on being married soon to my wife and after that type of commitment, I’ve finally embraced the fact that her debt is my debt and it is now up to me to get our finances on the right page.

For context, both [27] we bring home roughly 85k between us but that number is sure to rise at least another 10k-15k by the end of the year. Both have State jobs so we both get 12% of our gross income set aside to our State Pension[AZ]. 

I spent my early adulthood staying away from credit cards and the only Account I have open is my Vehicle. My credit score is 600-610
My lady made some rough decisions on the way and accumulated some debt on the way but she also keeps a decent credit score at 680-700

Now while the debt my woman has shocks the shit out of me, I also realize how much worst it could be if she didn’t work for the state. Because of this fact, she will be graduating with her Master this year and will owe $0 in student loans.

	But besides that point; our debt looks like this.
* Vehicle1: $29,393 left, 4.25% interest($530 min)
* Vehicle2: $10,726 left, 8.06% interest($253 min)
* Loan: $9,000 left, 24% interest($288 min)
* Card1: $5,100 left, 17.4% interest($85 min)
* Card2: $3,100 left, 15% interest($85 min)
* Card3: $550 left, 28.4% interest)($25 min)

	For the time being, what would you suggest be the best way to attack this. Debt snowball would suggest I pay off the $550(Card3) as fast as possible and tack on the $25 extra to (Card2) but the interest rates on Card1 and the Loan are so astronomical it puts me in a perplexed position. I’ve given ourselves a date of December 31, 2023 for all the debt to be paid off, but I need more guidance on how to cut this date down even more.


* Also in regards to BS#4, because we are already providing 12% towards our retirement thru the State Pension, what would you recommend we invest the other 3% in(once we have made it to that step)

t3_b6pjnf,Interested in doing the program again.,"A few years ago I took the course and read the books, well after about 5 months I fell off the wagon and went back to being normal.

Faster forward a few years.

I quit my job, start a new career and one week later my wife informs me we are having another child.

I withdrew all my retirement accounts I had with my old job when this news came. I then paid off my car, my 2 credit cards and 2 student loans. 
With that extra money I was able to pay off half of my debt and put money away so I could take a few weeks off of work when the baby came.


Well it’s been 6 months since then and the cost of having another child+remaining debt+ the lower income I have now has left me without any money at all, I am running negative nearly every week, all my money I make goes to daycare and living expenses. I am behind on utilities etc. I have cut a lot of my expenses on things such as TV and phones. I am going to see what I can cut further.

I am at my wits end, work has been slow and the jobs I get to work on are 100+ miles of one way driving. 


My question is, how do you guys stay disciplined on doing the budgets? I seem to lose steam after a while once the fire seems to be put out. How do you get your spouse to cut up the damn credit card, I feel better without mine.

t3_b6rxhy,Beginner and OVER budget!,"I enrolled in a small group at church for Dave’s Financial Peace University. This week we were to create our budget and my wife and I are $500+ over budget.


 And this was after cutting down everywhere we realistically can. There are a few small things that aren’t necessities but they are very inexpensive and helpful. For instance my wife’s gym is $10/month and her time at the gym is good for her physical and mental health and it’s near our home. I pay my therapist out of pocket but it’s only $20 per session. Even by cutting those things we’re still over by $500/month. 

**note: because I am self employed and due to my field, some portions of my income are unpredictable. Thus, we underestimated my income and also, may have over estimated some of our bills. But, at that we are still over by a few hundred. 


I can’t seem to find anything that says what to do if you’re over budget. Anyone know what Dave says if you are simply over budget?


Another question, trying to keep it short as I can: we have some charities to which we are giving included in our budget, we have money going toward building a larger emergency fund (we have the thousand saved, plus a little more), etc. our vehicle payments are a large part of our monthly expenses because we have poor credit. 

My truck is paid off in July, however I am self-employed, blessed enough to be building a business more each year and my truck is my livliehood. It’s reliability is making me very anxious right now, to the point we’ve decided I will have to get a newer one asap. 


Is it a good idea to take whatever money we can and save like crazy until the end of July in an attempt to purchase a new truck in full?This would mean sacrifing payments toward our school debt, building a larger savings, etc. But it would mean no more truck payments and no more interest. ",0

Scenario A: Debt (not including $40,000 mortgage) = $53,500. Mortgage = $600 per month. Surplus each month = $679. Emergency fund = $1,000.
 
Scenario B: Debt = $43,500. Rent = $800 per month. Surplus each month = $579. Emergency fund = $1,000.
 
Scenario C: Debt = $53,500. Rent = $800 per month. Surplus each month = $479. Emergency fund = 4 months.
 
Scenario C: Debt = $50,000. Rent = $800 per month. Surplus each month = $579. Emergency fund = 3 months.

I got a bachelors in video production, and worked one year in the industry following my graduation. I was only making about $13 at that company, and there was NO room for growth there...

So now for the help I need... I feel like a clueless child when it comes to this... \^\^ I have about $8,500 in a mutual fund account through Edward Jones. (My parents started the account and I have just been adding to it since receiving it). I also have about $3,200 outside of that in my bank account. I plan to save about $14,000-$16,000 a year through this job after all expenses (and complete my baby steps up to having 3-6 months worth of living expenses set aside). After completing that, what should I do? Should I open an Roth IRA account and only put 15% worth of my income into it a year? Do I leave my current mutual fund account alone? And also, what should I do with my extra money after my 15% going to my IRA if I open one?   


I'm not sure where I will be year to year, but I DO plan on staying here in South Korea for at least about two more years, so I don't know if I should be setting money aside for moving to a new place when done here...

t3_b6heve,Increasing Giving on Baby Step 3,"Hi Dave Ramsey Crew,

Love Dave's show and have been a devotee of his system for two years now. Amazingly, my wife and I just finished paying off 80K in debt -- we're debt-free! Throughout the process, we continually gave 10% off our gross income to various spiritual organizations. Now that we are on Baby Step 3, we would like to increase our giving, and have considered ramping this up to roughly 14% of our gross income.

When Dave talks about the Baby Steps on his show, he seems to lump BS3 in with BS2, saying that you don't let your foot off the gas until BS4. Are we 'jumping the gun' by ramping up our giving -- meaning we shouldn't do this until BS4 -- or do you think Dave would encourage us to make such an increase?

I know this is a  personal matter, and it comes down to your own feelings/desires (there's no tried-and-true rule for giving!), but I would appreciate external insights from fellow Dave devotees :)",0
t3_b6aks7,Sinking funds actually work!,"We recently had to get inspections and registration done on both of our cars. We have sinking funds for the inspections, and we cash flowed the registrations. However, inspection time is always a nailbiting experience. It seems that every year something (usually a tire issue) comes up and one of the cars fails inspection. These aren't old cars, but the roads around here chew through tires like it's nobody's business.

Anyway, this year was no different. The first car made it through fine, $140 total. The second car was the one I was nervous about. I noticed some uneven wear on one of the tires at the last oil change, and that tire was leaking air. 

Add on to this that we owe the IRS a gob of money this year (messed up the withholdings), and we held back the snowball payment this month, just to be safe. We had a car maintenance fund to cover a tire replacement, maybe 2 tires, but you never know.

I'm sure you can see where this is going. The car needed 4 new tires + alignment at an out-the-door cost of $850. Thankfully, the $375 car maintenance fund took a big bite out of that balance, as did the snowball payment (split between this and the tax payment).

t3_b60kmi,Finally actually debt free,"My wife and I became debt free except for our cell phones a few years ago, but we never considered our cell phones a “real” debt. In our last budget meeting we decided that our cell phone bill was too high for the 2 of us ($240). We ended up paying off our phones ($1400) so we could cancel two random extra phone lines that got added to get a “good deal” on our phone leases and canceling our insurance. Plus adding a military discount we thought was already being applied. Bringing our phone bill down to $80. 

I didn’t realize how heavy this last debt was weighing on my soul. I thought I was free after paying off our cars, but being 100% instead of 99% debt free feels amazing. I’m very excited, but I have no where else to brag. Thanks for reading!",0
t3_b6cebt,"Came into a small sum of money, how should I use it?","Debts:

46k Student Loan

999 CC 1

250 CC 2

**Question:**

I received a $1600 bonus after my company got """"""acquired"""""" by a much larger company and I'd like to know the best way to spend it.

**Choices:**

*1.) Put it toward a proper BS1 emergency fund*

I skipped BS1 because any emergency I've had has been way more than $1000. It would be nice knowing I have that much money in a savings account and that it is always there. With that said, I take care of my girlfriend while she is dealing with some medical issues and her family has always been willing to help out with expenses when we need them to since I am the only one earning an income. On my income alone I can support both of us for the most part. 

*2.) Pay off the CC*

This is one of my top two choices. The way I see it is once the CCs are out of my life, all I have is the student loan which is a much better situation than most people. I can go full Dave on my student loans, and that includes starting from BS1. In my opinion these are what Dave refers to as mosquito debts. They don't bother me the way the student loan does.

*3.) Buy an engagement ring/wedding ring*

This is my other top choice. My girlfriend and I have been together 7 years. We've been through all sorts of stuff together. We have lived together 6 of those 7 years. I love her and there is nobody else I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. The only other time I will have enough money is after I get some of these debts paid off and can save towards it so like another couple years. Due to our circumstances, I doubt we will ever have a traditional marriage. I'm not baptized, we don't have large families, and we only have a few close friends. We have talked about getting a courthouse marriage.

4.) *Bet it all on black*

This is obviously a joke, but I couldn't resist :P

Thought this could be a good WWDD exercise for us here.

I'll start by saying it doesn't look like they've considered BS2 in eliminating their student loan debt! But, on the flip side, they are doing a good job of maxing out their 401(k) contributions, except Dave recommends 15% of gross income, so they should really be putting an additional $39,000 into retirement funds.

1. Should I at least drag the payments out over the next year to get my credit score to go back up a bit.

2. If I pay it off all at once I’ll only have $500 left in my savings. (I have a different emergency fund savings account though).

We have $50k cash savings and $40k cash in our HSAs for healthcare costs that will come up. The vehicle that is yet to be paid off has around $20k remaining to pay off.

t3_b5uqzx,My First “You’re Weird” Reaction from Friends - it felt pretty great.,"I have to admit, I’m Dave-ish with regard to credit cards. I’ve continued to use two - one travel rewards card and an Amazon card - since finishing BS2 last month. I’m making good progress on BS3 thanks to a couple of windfalls, and I only use the credit cards for specific things and pay them off weekly.

Anyways... I was at a bachelorette party last weekend, and we went to an expensive cocktail bar. Since one of our friends couldn’t make it to the bachelorette weekend, she asked me to pick up a round of drinks for the group on her and she would reimburse me. We ended up getting two rounds, and I went to pay the bill.

I couldn’t locate my travel rewards credit card, which I use for reimbursable expenses, in my purse (because cocktails). So I used my debit card instead, but the way my friends reacted it was like I had no money to cover our $280 bill: “are you sure?”  “I can put it on my card instead” “you don’t have to do this” - no joke, people were so shocked I’d put the tab on a debit card.

I think it’s sad that they act like a debit card doesn’t act the same way as a credit card... it’s still money. The only difference to me is the 1% or so that I’d get back in travel rewards and the risk of paying interest if I don’t pay the balance. And thanks to DR, I’m not living paycheck to paycheck and can still cover all my bills even if I’m out $280 in cash for a few days.

t3_b62p0i,"Need more space, but is it wise?","About a 2 years ago my husband and I moved into a 800sqft apartment and are paying $700/mo for the place thanks to his mom owning the apartment (the other units are sitting at $850/mo). We are debt free and have a fully funded emergency fund and steady jobs. We have been able to shovel away about $700/mo consistently and still live in excess. My husband's mom also owns a townhouse that is 1600sqft and is renting pretty low at $1295/mo. The townhouse would be a significant increase in space and would be more comfortable for us and help us possibly start a family in the next few years. If we rent the townhouse, our savings would be diminished down but we can offset by cutting down our excess spending like dining out. With that said, I wouldn't necessarily be in a huge rush to buy a house if we are renting the townhouse, since I can see it fitting us for quite some time, especially when I graduate in 2 years and can potentially make significantly more money. Right now, the townhouse rent would be about 27% of our income before utilities. I guess I just want to hear some advice. Is this reasonable or am I blinded by the possibility?

t3_b5qw3s,Just came to a realization about cars,"I was thinking about warranties.  Only a couple manufacturers offer warranties beyond 30k/3 years.  Yet, I know as an engineer I'd trust the powertrain in any newly manufactured car to go 150k without question with regular maintenance.  Then I thought, maybe warranties are more of a tool a manufacturer uses to convince you to buy a new car.  Afterall, as much as an OEM may tout how reliable their cars are, they only make money if you trade it in and buy a new one.  By stopping the warranty at 3 years or 30k, you've artificially limited the life of the new car in the owner's mind, to the point they're already thinking about getting the next one.  I was guilty of this for several years thinking that 100k/10 yrs was the magic life of a car, and after that you needed to have a plan for replacement.

Fast forward to yesterday.  Driving home on my 25 minute commute I noticed more than half the cars driving are body styles from at least 10 years ago, most from 15 or more.  Just assuming average use, there's a crap ton of cars regularly being used as daily drivers that have 150k+ miles and are 15 or more years old.  I spent so much time convincing myself that cars don't last that long that it felt ok to go into debt to buy them.  I can confidently say, I've paid off my last car loan.

I guess Dave said it pretty well, ""Nobody became a millionaire because they got good financing terms borrowing money to buy cars.""",0

t3_b5t8p8,Has anyone taken 5+ years to finish BS2? What did your life look like during?,"I've been crunching numbers and the tl;dr version is that I'll be on BS2 for 5+ years due to student loans. **I'm not looking for advice or thoughts on those numbers.** I have my rough plan, I put a certain amount extra toward my student loans each month, when my salary goes up I'll reevaluate, etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

My main question is about your lifestyle and your mindset when BS2 lasts half a decade or more. *Most* people sprint through BS2 in 2-3 years, and I can understand how they do without things like eating out, vacations, buying more expensive kinds of foods, redecorating, etc. I'm essentially trying to figure out where ""the line"" is for me as I do my budget. I'm 28, single, and live in a major metro area.  There are extras in my life. But could I cut Netflix for 5 years? Could I refuse to darken the doorway of a Starbucks for that long, or eat oatmeal for breakfast and beans &amp; rice for lunch and dinner? I had contemplated cash flowing a trip for my 30th birthday but feel immensely guilty at the thought of going and thinking ""this trip is 1.5 months of extra student loan payments."" I can ""go without"" for periods of time, and I've been experimenting. I gave up Amazon Prime for Lent. I cut off my Hulu subscription, and I put $20 per month on my Starbucks card, which is down from an embarrassing amount (pre-Dave).

&amp;nbsp;

I suppose I'm really asking about more qualitative ideas and feelings, and what was sustainable for you vs. what wasn't and how you knew. Maybe it really does come down to line items on the budget, and I should first be militant about each category and reassess after a couple of months. Any advice or anecdotes would be appreciated. ",0

t3_b5bdho,Everyday Millionaires by Chris Hogan is a horrible book and I'd suggest using that $20 on baby step 6.,"Everyday Millionaires was TERRIBLE!  It was an absolute waste of my Audible credit. The second half of the book is just a watered down version of the baby steps and the first half cherry picks ""Everyday Millionaires"" who are either attorneys or individuals with graduate degrees.
 
He starts the book off by saying that you don't need a graduate degree to be a millionaire, but then three of the major examples he gave were attorneys. The other examples all had graduate degrees.  All of the examples he gave started right of college with investing in their 401Ks and saving money.  

I'm not saying that is bad, but he never gave an example of an individual who had a ""come to Jesus"" moment and started correcting their finances after they turned 30. He also blasted college and anyone who took out a student loan, but then he kept referencing individuals with juris doctorates, graduate degrees and PHD's.  It was extremely hard to listen as he would reference an attorney who is giving away his life fortune who lived off a ""small army pension"" or a man who took a job at an aerospace company and worked his way up to be a senior VP at an aerospace company.  

This book was marketed as if you neighbor who is an IT consultant down the street is secretly a millionaire and these are his secrets.  Instead, we hear about people who excel in their career and become senior leaders at large companies.  The only secret in this book is that you need a graduate degree and a time machine.

Dave's system works great and it appears as if Chris did the bare minimum when he was doing his research.  There are plenty of Millionaires who never got a college degree, like my grandparents, but Chris went for the WOW factor and pretty much farmed this book out.

I just got accepted into a paid PhD program, and Canadian student loans will be interest free the entire time I’m considered a student (7-10 yrs). I cannot pay them while in school. 

Now I owe 18k, we have a 3 month emergency fund. BUT every semester I complete school I get some sort of completion grant and student loan forgiveness as part of my living package. I also get money taken off after every degree I finish. I’ll make approx 25/yr which should increase every year (performance dependant)


So I have an interest free debt that is decreasing on its own and I don’t know what financial goal to focus on.

I'm fine with the program and am no stranger to Dave or his philosophy. Besides the goal of getting out of debt, our goal as a newly married couple was to use this program (and a shared bank account) to open up the lines of communication and to work as a team.

Here's what's getting to me though - it seems he just wants to blindly follow the program...period...and I find myself needing to push back.

For example, he was 100% ready to cut up his credit cards, though there's no good reason to. I told I didn't see a point of letting our FICO scores drop or to make car rental, etc., more difficult than it needed to be. As it turned out, at our FPU class yesterday around half of the folks there decided to keep at least one card, because not having any cards at all didn't make sense. I felt a little validated after seeing that.

So yesterday he finishes up the budget and said that he built in $500/month for giving!!! Um, no! He's put the pause on retirement contributions, we have debt to pay, two houses to sell, a new one to buy (and furnish, etc.) and during all that he feels it's wise to give away 12k a year? What the hell??

I do want to be in a better position to give someday, but not right now and not that much when we have so much we need to get in order yet!!

t3_b55mp6,Escaping the helicopter parents,"Hey all! Not really sure if I’m looking for advice or just encouragement... I thought you guys might have some insight into my situation.

I’m a senior in college, entering law school in the fall. I’ve known about Dave Ramsey for most of my life, since my dad is a big fan and listened to him a lot. I just started listening and learning more about finances recently, since I’m about to graduate and start life in the real world.

Throughout undergrad my parents and I split the cost of tuition, but due to increase in tuition each year we couldn’t quite cover it and I had to take out $9k in student loans for the last two years. I have about $2k saved right now. Amazingly, I got a full tuition scholarship for law school (yay!!!), and the school is commuting distance from my home, so I can live with my parents rent free and attend law school for free. I don’t have a car or the money to buy one, but the plan is that my parents will buy something cheap (~$5K) for me to commute to school, and I will pay them back as soon as possible. I plan on working as much as possible this summer- I’m applying to jobs but I don’t have anything lined up yet- and part time during law school.

My concern is this: my parents have been very generous, and I’m grateful that they’re helping out my broke self and making it possible to go to law school for free (minus the cost of the car, which I’ll pay back to them). However, I am really REALLY hoping to move out and become financially independent ASAP. My parents are great people, but they are also helicopter parents... they’ve always been somewhat controlling and over-involved in my life. This bothers me more as I get older and feel a stronger desire to live as an independent adult. I want to stop relying on them for money, because financial dependence means they have control over my life, which I dislike even though they’re reasonable most of the time. I’m broke and kinda stuck right now, because I need a car to be able to work, and I don’t have the money to buy a car. So I have to let them get me a car, after which I’ll have ~$14K in debt, and I won’t be able to work full time once school starts in the fall.

Does anyone have any thoughts about specific ways I can start becoming independent? I know maximizing income is the most important thing, but other than that? I’m feeling pretty overwhelmed, and worried that I’ll be relying on my parents until my late 20s, which sounds miserable. Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

t3_b555fk,The long and winding BS2 road,"Hey there!
I'm fairly new to Dave and glad I found him. Setting my budget and securing a 1k E-fund have really been motivational and helpful in giving my money a job.   
  
I listen to the podcast daily and get kind of bummed listening to the speed in which folks are able to tackle baby step 2. I fear mine will take years and have some questions. First, my situation:
   
I have a little over 100k in student loan debt. I took out loans to cover grad school + cost of living during the two year program (very intense, little time for work outside of school). I will say, it's the top school in the country for my field, so while the loans themselves weren't financially smart, I don't regret this investment in my career (job placement is 97% within 6 months of graduation. I found one weeks after graduation, thankfully!). 
   
Here are some details:  
* I make 60k/year.  
* I live in NYC and live with three roommates.  
* I'll likely be making 80-90k within 3 years, based on industry averages.  
   
I'm currently on Income-based repayment that was calculated when I was in a 2-month long intern period, so my payments aren't even covering the principle. BUT, this is giving me the opportunity to completely pay off an old credit card that should be kaput in 2 months.   
  
I'm wondering if I should just be staying the course and paying off this enormous debt as BS2 prescribes, or if there is any other strategy for a ""long BS2"". I regret that I've yet to read his books, so really just looking for a little guidance!

t3_b4ynxb,Friend wants to mortgage paid off house to pay off credit cards.,"Just curious what the WWDD consensus is on this situation.  I don’t know the whole situation, but I’ll give what I can.

Our friends have maybe about $130k in debt based on prior conversations.  Not sure if that is the true number as they have quoted different numbers to different people, but that’s the highest quoted to us and my wife is the best friend of the female in this relationship, so maybe it’s correct.  They have several credit cards that are a part of that, but we don’t know how much.

Their idea is to mortgage their paid off house (they bought it cash with inheritance money) to pay off their debt in 10 years saving $1,000/month interest based on what they’ve told us.  He is a design engineer for an automotive electrical supplier and she does some part time work as a receptionist.  They also do photography for weddings and other occasions on the side.  So we would guess their income is around $100-115k.

We want to help them with sound, fact-based advice, but are not sure where to start.  We are also not sure how to approach the situation to begin with.  Maybe we shouldn’t?  I figure they are open to talking about it, so maybe they are open to our advice?

  If we move we have a good chunk to throw at a house. Cost of living in the new city is actually slightly lower than where we currently are. We are a family of 6, would prefer a 4 bedroom. New area we could find what we want around $350,000.

t3_b4t2g8,Getting into Baby Step 4," 

I'm in Baby Step 4, it's time I (and my budget) act like it.

Dave talked a lot about Baby Step 4 in the past week, probably because of the cruise (Sadly, I will not be going). And he said over and over that there are three things you do with money:Give it, save and invest it, and spend it.

So I have plans to rework my budget from the ground up, with that in mind. I worked out what my new net amount would be with 15% of my gross going into retirement.

I plan to put 3% into my work's 401K (they match 50% of that), and the remaining 12% into a Roth. I don't make enough to max out either right now, so No mutual funds right at this moment.

My overtime money, as well as any extra after budgeting, will be going into a savings account, seperate from my emergency fund. I also plan to try and get a part time job to add even more income. Every penny of that will be going into that same savings account. I'm thinking of using that to save a down payment on a house.

I'm looking at the expenses I have control over the amount in order to accomodate my new take home.

Good ideas, or an I acting like an April Fool?

t3_b51nv1,Investing won't make you rich.,"[Investing won't make you rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAXPDDnrpW4&amp;t=4s)

Short answer. The returns of investing are never going to be more than 10% and most of our efforts to beat this actually end up in us earning less. 

I find this relevant here, especially if you go to 7:20 where mentions the 3 things that hinder investors:

- Capital not available
- Captial being needed for other purposes
- Psychological factors. 

If you look at Dave's philosophy with money. He says to work hard to build character and get on a budget. Then he recommends getting rid of all debts and make reasonable purchases that are an affordable percentage of your net income. Finally, he reccomends geting help with investing. 

These 3 things address, exactly, the factors mentioned above. Yet this video is independant of anything DR. Its things like this that make me question the haters and think that dave really knows what he's talking about, including things like stopping 401(k), using fee based funds with an advisor, and avoiding debt.

2. I have a job with tons of overtime hours throughout the year. This job also has tuition reimbursement program for up to 75% of everything covered as long as I am full time.

t3_b3qvka,Baby Step 2 - Young(ish) Adult trying to be independant,"Hi all! I will try to keep this short.

Quick background. I am 26 and **still** living at home with my parents, after using my tax refund to bring my debt down to 18K and making 50k salary according to my 2018 W-2. I am a full time accounting clerk and a full time student working on a Bachelors in Accounting and Finance. 

# **Story Time**

I only just discovered Dave Ramsey 2 weeks ago and before I started the baby steps I was trying to get debt free but I was going about it the wrong way. 

I took out a personal loan to consolidate all my bad choices as a teen. 

I didn't really have bad spending habits until I made the mistake of being a sucker and giving a ""friend"" all 3K of my money leaving me broke and unable to afford simple things. Of course he told me he'd pay me back in a month...We are not friends anymore. During that month I lived on credit cards and went away for school. I came back after a semester realizing I was far too into the hole. 

My mom doesn't know about my lending 3K to a friend but she does know I used credit cards and accumulated 25K in debt. Worst part was I was working minimum wage so it took so long to break this wall down. 

Fast forward to 8 years later I am still in the hole because of all my bad choices. Now I am working a decent job and changed my major from Art and Illustration to Accounting realizing I was going to remain broke my whole life if I didn't change.

I am 2 years into my degree and have a little over a year to go. 

I locked away all my cards and use a budgeting tool to track my money. 

**TLDR - OP was stupid and gave away all her money, had to live on credit cards, went away to school on a stupid useless degree. Realized she was dumb and changed to Accounting, came home and went to community college, and starting paying off debt of 25K with a job that paid $9/hour at first then got a better job with better pay.**

# **The Numbers**

I got a raise in the middle of the year and now make about $60K before taxes (2018 W-2 was 50K)

My personal loan is $18K

I take about 50% of each paycheck and chop down on my debt. (By my math it should be a year! Yay)

I live at home where I give my mom about $350 (she's being very kind since she wants me to be debt free) and I contribute around the house by primarily cleaning or cooking but she helps as well. 

# **My Question**

What would you do in my shoes? Besides tackling the debt I want to be more independent but I am ignorant on where to begin moving out after I chop down this wall. 

I live in NY and I feel like finding a cheap place to rent is beyond difficult unless you have roommates. 

Is it ignorant of me to want to buy a home or condo (a condo in hopes of getting a home later)?

My fiancee and I want to get on the same page about marriage and money but it's a daunting challenge when we work opposite shifts. We have weekends together and try to cram a week's worth of relationship into a few hours. It's not working. We consider every other goal secondary to this one. This is my primary motivation.

I've held 2nd shift unskilled labor employment since 2005. Coming up on 10 years with my current employer, local government. The pay and benefits are exceptional so I'm hesitant to leave. I'd certainly take a pay cut and we're only 2 weeks ahead of paycheck-to-paycheck. Moving to day shift within the department would be optimal. Openings are rare.

I can't keep working manual labor forever. I want to get into a desk job within the next 10 years. Again, if that's with the current employer that would be ideal.

I'm currently in tech school through the union, Operating Engineers, and I earned an Associate of the Arts in Mathematics in 2009. Pursuing the tech option would likely land me in a graveyard shift which is preferable to the current situation. The AA degree's only value seems to be credit towards a BA or BS.

t3_b382ww,Tip when selling your cars: Report the sale,"This sounds obvious, but I confess I have sold at least two cars (that I can recall) without properly reporting the sale to the state Dept of Licensing (or DMV). 

If the buyer of your vehicle registers the car in their name, all ends well. If they don't, and instead they do something not-great with it, you are the owner of record for the vehicle. An example presents itself often at my work: cars abandoned on city streets get towed away, and the owner (according to DOL/DMV) is held responsible for the costs, which are *hundreds at minimum.* 

&amp;#x200B;

In Washington State, you need the buyer's full name and address. With that, you can report the sale on the DOL website. It costs $8, which I think has stopped some people from doing it, but man is it worth it if your buyer (or whoever they might sell it to without recording that sale!) gets into trouble with your car.

So report the sale of your vehicles properly, according to the DOL guidelines. Look them up in advance, and be prepared to get whatever information is required.",0

It has a guy on it, and he goes, “I’m a guy… And I want to tell you about reverse mortgages.” You’ve probably never heard of them, but you all know what a mortgage is. That’s when you and your loved one, you get together a grubstake – you know, a little bit of money – and, by God, you put it down on a piece of land or a house, you know? And then, every month, you pay what’s called a mortgage, you know? Which is some money to the bank. And then 20 years pass, or 30, and you have a big party with your friends. All your kith and kin come, and you burn the mortgage, and, by God, you own a piece of the American dream. Anyway, this is the complete opposite. “So uh… we would be glad to send you some brochures.

t3_b2pcdj,"Free of debt! $61,000 paid off in one year.","Hello,

My wife and I are debt-free as of Friday. We paid off $61,000 in exactly 12 months. The debt consisted of a little bit of everything: two cars, a personal loan, a credit card, and student loans. It has been a while since I’ve listened to Dave (I stopped when the focal point became hawking Hogan’s book), but I’m trying to answer the stuff he asks during the debt-free screams.

Nothing scary set us on this journey. A little over a year ago, I decided I should learn a bit more about money. I searched online for the best-rated books and of course The Total Money Makeover was one. I didn’t realize it was about debt. I figured it was how to invest and get rich quick! Debt was normal, so I probably wouldn’t have purchased the book if I had paid more attention to the synopsis.

I wouldn't say anyone really thought we were crazy or awesome, aside from our parents thinking it was cool. I realized quick that if I mention that I don't like debt, other people take it as a personal attack on them (even though I don't even inquire as to what they are doing financially). So honestly, nobody really even knows what my wife and I did. I'm a pretty private person.

When we started, our income was around $125,000. It’s currently around $85,000. I am in the military and my wife was a high school teacher before the military moved us. She is not interested in teaching anymore, so she is doing odd jobs while applying for the DoD system. That’s why our income dropped so much. We did make $17,000 from selling our house. I didn’t intend to play the market. I wouldn’t have bought a house had I known what I know now. It just happened to work out this time. I will say this though: we were originally on orders to move somewhere else a year prior. The market and time of year at that time would have seen us losing around $10,000. We got extremely lucky we did not end up doing that move. Don’t play the market!! We did use one of Dave's ELPs or whatever they are called. The guy was really good, aggressive, and smart. We sold our house for the asking price and total time on the market was six days. He did think we could have made more, but I was on a time crunch.

The most important piece for this was a zero-based budget that forced us to make decisions while weighing consequences. If we budgeted $200 for clothing that month, and we went over $200, we didn’t just add more from our pool of money. The deficit had to come from another category! An example would be if we ended up spending $225 on clothing, and we had budgeted $80 for gifts, we would move $25 from gifts over to clothing. That left us $55. It really made us consider if it was a purchase we were willing to make. We did have several categories that we budgeted, including but not limited to: travel, dogs, and stuff I forgot to budget for.

I also think it’s important to treat yourself now and then if possible. We allotted ourselves $50 of fun money each per month. It would carry over too. If I only spent $20 of it, then I’d still add $50 next month which totaled $70. Doing this really helped me become content with the things I already had. Why am I buying books when I have many I haven’t even read? Video games when I have ones I haven’t played? Etc. etc.

My final tip is this: if you are on the fence about taking out student loans and think you are better off going against Dave’s advice, please reconsider. My wife’s student loans were from before we were married. When she graduated college, she had $15,000 in loans. After making the minimum payments for seven years, you know what amount we had to pay off during our debt-free journey? We paid a lump sum of $27,000. Yes, even while she made seven years of payments, her loan amount GREW BY $12,000.

Anyway, that’s my short novel. Thanks for reading, and please ask questions if you have any.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, would it be ok to go ahead and somewhat begin baby step 4 by only putting enough in our 401k to get our employer match (5% for one of us, 6% for the other; not going all the way to baby step 4 and 15% towards retirement)?

We aren't planning on saving up 100% cash to purchase, just a 20% down payment.

t3_b2litc,At BS6 and faced with dilemma: Pay down Primary Residence or profit producing Rental House.,"Hello!  Thank you for taking the time to read my question!   

I am 46 and my wife is 51.  This is our second marriage each, and she owned a home when we met that timed out to be a great investment as housing prices took off right after she bought her house.  When she moved in with me we decided to rent it, and are are clearing $750 after the mortgage is paid and have not had a lapse in tenants in the entire 5 years we’ve been renting it.   The home is valued at $460,000 and we have $180,000 to pay on it with 24 years left and 3.25% fixed. We make monthly payments while kicking in an extra $150 each month to create an extra payment each year.

The home I owned when we met is valued at $440,000 and we have $205,000 to pay on it with 12 years left and a 2.75% fixed, making biweekly payments plus an extra $50 each payment (x26) on top of that.  I calculate that on this trajectory we could have it paid off in 9-10 years.  

We are meeting our 15% retirement goals, have 6-9 months emergency set aside, and find ourselves holding an extra $30,000 in savings beyond the emergency fund that we think we should apply towards early home payoff.  The rental property is a great home and will have no problem being rented at a profit, and our home is somewhere that we want to stay until retirement at least.   From clearly a financial point of view (not emotional) does anyone know which mortgage we should pay down first?  And why that would be?     Thanks for your feedback!     ",0

t3_b2bamp,"Time to change the flair, we are DEBT FREE!","Last year my Wife and I were sitting on a beach in Jamaica still in DEBT but had just read Dave's Total Money Makeover. I felt dumb for being there after reading the book but knew I wanted what I had read about in the book. I had also heard a few debt free screams at the point. 

My Wife has always been a lot better with money but we really made a big mess when we were younger and it took us years to fix the credit cards which we did before we knew of Dave. I mean $30,000 range of CC debt alone, heck even two dogs were financed but we clamped down got a cheap apartment and cleaned up 90% of the CC debt and bought an FHA loan house in 2012 at a market low. We then just kind of went along, each finishing Associates Degrees on loans, getting vehicles, and even a stupid furniture loan. 

Skip forward to last year when we went on Vacation and both read the book. At that time my Wife was a bigger listener than I had realized and started budgeting and I guess pushing me to get with it. I did and we did and it was GREAT! We paid off $30,000 in student loan debt, $25,000 in car loans, and a $2500 furniture loan all since last April. We will wake up tomorrow being debt free with only our $139,000 mortgage left.

t3_b2jegn,Career Related Question -,"Good Morning DR FAM!!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a career related question. It is my first time posting in this group, and I am quite nervous. I am sorry for the long post.

&amp;#x200B;

Background Story: 

I am currently in baby step two and should be done by June 2019. I have already paid off close to 76k worth of consumer debt (sold my car) and have about $23k left. The remaining 23k is my student loan debt. I will be done BS2 by August and done with baby step 3 by October.

&amp;#x200B;

My current salary is 133k. I should get a 10k bonus at year end for 2019. I should be around 143k at year end. I am 26. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have found a new opportunity in a new state that should pay about $210-220k a year. They also would pay for transitional housing for about six months and cover all moving related expense. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I would have to repay my current company a 23k sign on bonus. I have about 9k in PTO balance that I could repay it. I would still owe them about 15k. I don't have the cash saved to pay them at the moment. I could take a small personal loan to cover the delta. Once I start the new gig, I could repay that 15k in 2 months (assuming they give me 220k). I know Dave Ramsey would never recommend a personal loan; however, I don't know what to do at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I am miserable in my current job and just am struggling. I don't want to seem that I am ungrateful, but I work in a very toxic environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or suggestions would be much appreciated.",0
t3_b28erh,"WE’RE DEBT FREE!!! A story of young love, tragedy, and new hope.","TL;DR at the bottom. 

I graduated from school in 2012 and was married in 2013.  We were young, but I still believe that it was the best decision for us.  My husband and I wanted to start our family about six months into the marriage.  We were broke, but assumed that we’d figure it out as we went along.  That was when tragedy struck. 

In December of 2014, our daughter was stillborn.  We still don’t know what happened.  This case is the rarest of the rare.  Our friends, family, and church were so generous.  The church paid for the medical bills, and we didn’t have to worry about food for weeks.  We were numb, but well taken care of. 

Fast-forward a year later, and I’m huge pregnant for our second child.  Our son.  Around this time, FPU was starting at my church, and the leader was harassing us to go.  “Life-changing” was what I kept hearing.  Yeah, right, I was just broke because we didn’t have good jobs yet.  Besides, I couldn’t afford milk, much less this class!  A secret sponsor came forward, and we decided, reluctantly, to go. 

This class really did change my life.  My family still says that it was FPU that gave me life again.  I finally had something that I could control!  I jumped in with both feet.  I taught a small-group class where we read one of the Dave Ramsey books.  We paid off debt after debt, despite barely making more than minimum wage.  I listened to the shows and podcasts and daily.  I was officially a Dave Ramsey nerd!

Here we are, a few years later.  Our debts weren’t huge, but neither was our income.  Dave Ramsey not only helped me get out of debt, but gave me hope to keep going with every aspect of my life!

We now have two beautiful and healthy children and big plans.  I remember saying to my now-husband when we were first dating that my dream wasn’t to be rich, but to be comfortable and have no debt.  At the time, it felt like something that only rich people could do.  Now, I’m one of them!

TL;DR - In our five years of marriage, my husband and I started out broke.  After losing our first daughter, we became like zombies.  Dave Ramsey helped us gain control of not just our money, but gave us back control of our lives and the courage to keep moving forward.  We now have two healthy children, and a bright future. ",0

I got home and decided I wanted to do some extensive excel projections on how things would look if we did things the ""right"" way, and how long it'll take us to be debt free.

&amp;#x200B;

**Debt:**

Car payment: $456 ($5,500 balance)

Student loans: $181 ($33,000 balance)

\+ $2,183.00 snowball payments

&amp;#x200B;

**Fun milestones:**

Our car loan will be paid off with our May 2019 payment

Our student loans will be paid off with our May 2020 payment

Our $13,000 6 month emergency fund will be funded in September 2020

We'll begin funding retirement at that point (we currently have this paused)

We will put our snowball towards savings, and have $60,000 for a down payment by May 2023

&amp;#x200B;

We plan to buy a home in the $225,000 price range with $60,000 down in Spring 2023. On a 15 year mortgage, the total PITI mortgage payment will be approximately $1,600.00 total. We are projecting high on the interest rate since we don't know how they'll look in a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

We plan to pay at least $3,000/month on our mortgage (increasing it by $100/year), invest $565/month in mutual funds, and continue to save 15% each month for retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_b2fnae,Should I pay off my car right away?,"TL;DR at the bottom

A friend introduces me to Dave Ramsey and he got me hooked. I'm addicted to his YouTube videos and I'm now reading his book.

Quick backstory.
Couple years ago I finished college ($15,000 in student loans) and I got an okay job. It paid about $18/hr. My wife also works and gets paid about $20/hr. Since we each had a job I made the awesome (more like stupid) decision of buying a $20,000 car. It was used so I though I was saving money. I also have a used car that I paid cash at the time, it's probably worth about $1,000. We also had approximately $6,000 in combined CC debt.
We rent so we don't have a mortgage
Total debt is approximately $41,000.

About a year ago I got a new job which is in my field and I make approximately $30/hr. Not the best but great experience to upgrade (soon hopefully), but because of my new job we were able to pay off our CCs.

Before knowing Dave Ramsey we saved up approximately $15,000.

My wife and I decided that our baby step 1 would be a savings of $5,000 (we have family out of the country and it would cover the flights in case of an emergency).

I was planning on just (aggressively) save up until we have $20,000 on savings, pay the car in full, then use the car payments to pay the loan. 

Would that be the best option?

TL;DR:
I know Dave's steps, but we saved almost enough to pay off our car($20,000). Should I just pay it off and then work on my student loan, which has less interest or just follow the baby steps? ",0

t3_b1t7ld,Our debt free scream!,"""In the lobby of /r/DaveRamsey, we have /u/Newportor...

How much have you paid off? Around $70k CDN, plus an additional $19k saved for a new-ish car that we will be purchasing in a couple of weeks for my wife’s work as a sales representative (we added this to our snowball due to upcoming contractual obligations).  So just short of $90k total.

How long did that take? 2 Years 9 Months.

Household income during that time? Started at $40k (one income), ended around $145,000 (two incomes).

What kind of debt was this?  Student loans ($65k), credit cards ($5k), upcoming car fund ($19k).

What happened {X months/weeks/years} ago to light you guys on fire?  I started reading a whole bunch of personal finance books and blogs on my hour-long commute while riding on transit back in late 2016.

Whose idea was this?  Mine.

How does it feel?  Pretty surreal, but it will hit my wife at the end of this month when she won’t have to set aside money for student loans.

How old are you? 33 &amp; 31.

What was the hardest part of this whole process?  Wife and I used to keep our finances separate (even after we got married), so I would be saving my leftover income while she was using her income to pay down her student debts.  After a Dave Ramsey video I saw on YouTube about the concept of merged finances for married couples, I decided to use my share of the savings to pay down the student loan debt.

What would you tell people is the key to getting out of debt?  Learning to cook nice food at home reduces the temptation to dine out; cooking leftovers and meals in bulk also helps to cut costs and not require takeout food apps when you don’t feel like cooking.

Did anyone make fun of you during this time?  My parents thought we were weird for not dining out or going on nice vacations.  My parents also thought we were weird for eloping as a way to cut down on wedding costs.   My in-laws were supportive of our aggressive debt repayment though.

What are you going to do now that you don’t have any payments?  Start saving up for a down payment for a house and pay cash for a car!

Did (or are you) going to call into the live show to scream? If so, let us know!  No, but we are heading to the lobby of Ramsey Solutions in May 2019 while on a trip to Tennessee and Kentucky to personally thank Dave for helping us find a way to repay our debt!

t3_b1z9ya,Ready! Set! Go!,"  

Good evening everyone!

I’m a new Dave Ramsey listener and have begun taking the Baby Steps. I am currently on Step One.

Let me say a bit about me before continuing. My biggest issue has always been impulse spending/emotional spending using credit cards. I signed up for my first card in 2006 in college – for the free t-shirt. If I had known where this “simple decision” would lead me, I would’ve walked right past that table. Unfortunately, the glimmer of being an adult and having my own credit card won out.

Fast forward to today. I’ll be thirty-one years old in early April, I have had a job with the same company for nearly 6 years, and I live at home with my mother. She’s also in dire financial straits, but I’m not sure I can look at her debt without having a nervous breakdown and losing the will I have to pay off my own debts.

I’m already overwhelmed. Here’s a breakdown of my finances. I would ask for honest, but respectful feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

Take-Home Pay = $2200/month

Credit Debt – Roughly 27k.

Student Loans – 44k

&amp;#x200B;

It’s a tall order, but I will do it. 😊

I have my EF of $1,000 sitting in a money market, and am going to throw my $3,400 tax return at the principle (I’ll adjust my W4 here shortly so I won’t get as large of a refund next year). 

My question is, do you all think Dave would tell me to sell off the securities hanging out in the stock market to help pay off the debt? I have just a little over $3000 in various stocks. 

I did a pretty comprehensive breakdown earlier tonight and I’ll have the truck paid off in less then a year without touching that $3000. I personally don’t want to sell the stocks off since they are performing rather well and I feel like they have even more potential to grow.

Over the years, he's chosen to help various kids in various ways. He's cut back a good deal but still probably pays around 350ish monthly on them. I have no such ""obligations"". 

As we prepare to start our baby steps, is it fair that all of my income (including my side hustle) goes towards our goals while he is still helping his adult kids? I feel selfish for thinking this way, and I can't figure out if I'm being selfish or not.",0

t3_b0urav,Car debt free!,For the first time since I was 17 years old I’m going to have no car payment. (Currently 29) We are going in tomorrow to pay the wife’s car off.

We’re sitting on an emergency fund of 3 months which will be 6 months soon and then paying her school by the end of this year.

t3_b14nsd,Where to start?,"I have been wanting to get some debt paid off but I am afraid to touch my savings.  Any suggestions or ideas of where to start?  

I own my own home, which is a money pit.  I am planning on relisting it again in a few weeks and go back to renting to save about 1,000/month.  My current mortgage payment (with no repair bills) is $915/month.  My fear is that I will have to bring money to the table (possibly $5,000??), and I don't know if it will be worth it.  

I have $9800 in savings, I owe $13,000 on my car ($285/month), $16,000 on a student loan bill ($100/month) that will have $5,000 forgiven in May (hopefully), and $600 in cc bills (will be paid using my taxes).  I currently net $1676/bi weekly.  I also have $50/paycheck deducted for a 403b.  I don't know if draining my savings (minus $1,000) would be worth the savings each month.

t3_b10pw1,"Savings ""snowball"" has stopped. WWDRD?","So I grew up very very poor all my life and was jointly making about 50K a year before taxes when I got divorced 11yrs ago. every time I put 5 bucks into savings something would break or be emergency. We had about 10K in credit card debt when we divorced.

&amp;#x200B;

I was making 42/yr (newly) when I went through messy divorce and was paying 1300/mth for daycare, paid about 30K in legal over course of 2yrs, stuck with mortgage, and wasn't getting any child support. how I kept the lights on, i'll never know.

&amp;#x200B;

Where I live, I am legally not allowed to leave the area unless I surrender the kids to my ex. my family lives on the other side of US. So great was my terror that if anything happened (having lived through dot com bubble and post 9/11 econ downturn where I was struggling to be employed for most of 00-03. I would get job and work 6-12 weeks, get laid off. 4-6m to find another job. rinse and repeat) I'd lose house and thusly custody of the kids I kept squeezing the blood from the turnip once divorce dust settled.

As my expenses decreased over the years (namely, daycare which finally disappeared completely last year) and my income increased (going from 42/yr to over 100K a year) I kept living like I had been. currently I put approx 1/2 of my checks into savings and any child support I receive (he hasn't paid his 500/mth support in a year at this point) as well.

&amp;#x200B;

In a matter of 6(ish) years I managed to acquire enough savings that I could quit my job and not work at all until my youngest finishes highschool with almost no lifestyle change.

And I think thats whats causing me some panic mode here.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the last errm.....2 years or so my savings has completely stalled out. I've been savings the same number but the house I bought 14yrs ago needed a LOT of repairs 14yrs ago....and ignoring them hasn't fixed things ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I've bought a 2nd car (my oldest is 15 so he'll be driving soon, both kids play HUGE instruments and have huge appetites, and my freeloading brother moved in for a few weeks and 3.5yrs later is still here without a car.... and I didn't want to give  up my manual transmission mini-crossover as my daily driver) which was a bit of a luxury last summer, I've replaced water heater, washer/dryer, all new windows and doors for whole house, painted and new carpet and furniture and mattresses for my 2 kiddos, rebuilt fireplace that was crumbling and had new chimney cap installed, after hailstorm (so ins paid lions share) I got whole new roof and house painted patched and new gutters done, paid off the 20 portion of my 80/20 loan on the house in full, etc etc. oh, and I finally took my kiddos on first vacation trip EVER last summer (also part of decision to buy 2nd car - a 5yr old used minivan)

&amp;#x200B;

so my savings ""snowball"" has all but stalled. I think it's grown a bit, but not much.

since january I've paid off my property taxes, paid my lawyer 4K (because ex isn't paying child support, court date has been postponed 3 times now. urg) and paid 8K of the 14K contractor quoted me to do a stud out renovation of my tiny bathroom (1 of 2) that hasn't been functional most of the 14yrs i've lived here.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized my kids will be adults in 3 and 6 years respectively and i've been living on ""beans and rice, rice and beans"" for their entire lives and I have super limited time to do things before they grow up and fly the nest.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point my master bath is/was grosser (completely molded shower/tiles/caulk because of mold and leaking behind walls. replacing it buys me months maybe before it comes right back, sink is atrocious etc) than my hall was, but shower was functional albeit really gross. Kids and I were discussing possible travel vacation ideas and they settled on a 3K cruise as what they would LIKE to do. master will probably cost about the same 16K or so (possibly a bit more due to having glass doors done in master vs hall)

My kitchen tile i've got popped tiles and chunks of tile coming out of the floor at this point, and carpet in my bedroom and living room are gross and 25yrs old. I just wasn't even considering replacing them until bathrooms were addressed (due to constant leaks and mold)

&amp;#x200B;

AND I owe 90K on my house still (I think payoff is under 80K however) and part of me is thinking I should take kids on vacation and do renovations and then start doubling down on my 401K and mortgage payments.

&amp;#x200B;

but all that would mean savings will stay at a 0 increase and that makes me sad.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is...when you've lived on beans and rice/rice and beans, when is it OK to spend money finally and should I focus my $$ on those things now??

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR -

I have built up savings, but things i've ignored for a long time are finally calling. not sure when to release the purse strings and feel OK that savings isn't growing anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

income - approx 7K (depending on if ex pays his 500/mth support or not)

bills - approx 3K a month

cars - 2014 minivan and 2015 manual transmission ""mini"" crossover (kia soul) I owe 2K on

house - bought (133K) owe (\~90k or less) worth (comps are 260+ in the neighborhood)

savings :

120K in low risk/low reward investment account

50K in roth IRA from 401ks at previous jobs

35K in high APR savings/checking account (it was 4%, I think it's 3% now)

25K in regular savings account (going to move it, was just waiting on these big expenses) - minus 6K I need to pay contractor in like a week or so

Waiting on :

my ex SHOULD be ordered to pay all my legal this time (lawyer has 4K retainer, has only billed 900 so far) plus the \~7K he will owe at the time of court.

bonus @ work - should be getting around 3K after taxes, official numbers haven't been posted yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Total Debts :

\~90K on house (payoff was around 80K when I checked last)

2K on my one car (I just threw 2K at it in feb I think. was thinking I should pay it off finally)

0 in credit card, I never went to college so never had school debt.

t3_b0rt3h,What kind of savings account for down payment?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently about half way through baby step 3 and I'm planning on saving up for a down payment (or pay cash for the whole thing!) as soon as I'm done. I'm currently renting and since I work remotely, I don't have a place or set date in mind for where I want to buy a home yet meaning that the money could sit there for a while. My rent is less than 15% of my take home pay which gives me space to save a lot, but I don't want inflation to eat away at my house down payment savings while I decide.

My husband works as much overtime as his job and body will allow and I work a full 40 a week while going to school part time.

A little about me. I am a 25 year old single full time RN in a nursing home. Mama to my two fur kids, Storm and Reina (Ill add some pictures in the post later). I make approximately 2710 net a month, thats without picking up shifts/staying late, ect

I rent an apartment and am able to generally cover all my monthly expenses with no issues.

My only debts are student loans and a car loan
24,098 total for student 
1. 4,933.54
2. 5,059.47
3. 7,147.83
4. 6,958.02
 and
11,248 for car

I have no credit card debt. Don't use one for over a year.

When looking at the snowball, would you pay off the student loans by seperating them like I did?

Looking for maybe some encouragement, other people like me, support, advice, whatever else.

I love my parents and their advice. I think they are just scared that if I dump that nest egg, crazy stuff is going to happen and I am going to get into financial trouble, because car breaks down, something happens with the kitties, ect

I would probably start in April with a fresh budget. How do I best prepare for that? Just take all of my current savings/cash and throw it at current bills/debt, then.... I get paid on friday and I have tax returns coming.... Just not sure how to even start in the middle of the month when most things have already been payed

monthly expenses (not including gas/groceries and some other miselanious things) is approximatly 2,076.

t3_b0fvmm,Just Paid Off 1st Debt of My Debt Snowball!," Just called Portfolio Recovery and arranged for a direct debit of $256 on Friday 3/15 so that it will be paid in full! This will be the first debt of my snowball that I have paid off!

&amp;#x200B;

Good news is that I feel good and motivated to continue, I can do this!

&amp;#x200B;

Not so good news is that it was only a $50/month payment... But, it is $50 a month freed up to put towards my next debt which is a medical bill. Once that is paid off (should be by June/July) that will be a total of $250 to put towards the next one. That one is currently $1500 so by July will be down to $1300 (currently am paying $50/month) and then once I start putting the $250 + $50 towards that I should be able to knock it out by December. If I can get these 3 paid off by the end of 2019 I will be thrilled! That will leave me with only 1 debt left which by December should be down to @$2500 but has interest.

My wife and I are in our late 30s, and we have decided we wish to buy our own business and move locations.  This year I finished paying off over 200,000k in student loan debt, and we only have our home mortgage left.  We wish to make this move ASAP (within 1year) as an opportunity arises. I am currently on baby step 4,5,6.  I recently paid off over 200K in student loans and do not want to go back into debt if possible. EVERYONE is telling me just borrow the money, that's what everyone does...but I just can't do that, its not me.  I also can't stay where I'm at anymore for personal ""family"" reasons, and because my wife and I want to move.

&amp;#x200B;

**Income:** My wife and I both work, combined gross income is **$260,000.**  We put 15-20% into retirement (Max out the 19,000 for 2019), and save $400 month for college. (I'm looking to buy a practice that will cost me in the $600,000 range, and if all works out should allow me to draw a salary of at least $200,000.  My wife will likely find a new job making at least 50% more than she does now, so we are looking at our new combined salary being potentially around **$300,000**

**Net Worth:** \&gt;920,000 (All assets-debt)

**Home Equity:** About $325,000 (at a conservative market value.  Home is worth about $915,000, mortgage of about $590,000 left at 4%

**Retirement:** We have about $430,000 in Retirement (401K, IRA, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash:** $80,000

&amp;#x200B;

**Investments**: $70,000 (Non-retirement)

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who just got out of debt, the thought of taking out $600,000k loan sounds like a nightmare! If I throw cash at the situation, stop contributing to retirement and save Maaaaaybe I can get that $600K down to 300K, but I'm eventually going to have to buy a new home, and I'm not sure throwing your home equity at a business that can potentially fail is a good idea.

I wanted to thank this community on reddit for keeping me focused, motivated and grounded above all. Today, I paid my final debt (a Credit card with 0% Interest, feels so good even though it was at 0%). Now on to BS3

Here is my journey: I started full throttle 8 months back ([original post is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaveRamsey/comments/8seizl/which_bs_should_i_handle_the_3_mortgages_i_have/)). 

Over the last 1 year, i have paid more than $48K in debt (including CCs, Student Debt,  long distance mortgage and a HELOC). 

I started with 2 Mortgages + 1 HELOC. Common consensus here was to sell all real estate as Dave would not be a long distance landlord. I am in the process of selling these houses, however, wanted to finish the smaller mortgage + HELOC under BS2 (both were &lt;50% of annual income). Also, I am pretty close to selling the house which has the bigger mortgage (&gt;50% of annual income). For the homes, I am planning to sell the 2 paid for small houses and roll up all the equity for down payment of a home near to where I am living now.

*How did I do it?*

* Setting Monthly Goals (somewhat undervalued yet super effective). 
* I saved every possible $$ (without being stingy) - budgeting on YNAB helped a lot. 
* Side hustle - website development. 
* Flipping phones/electronics on like of Craiglist and Facebook Marketplace. 
* Did try selling on Amazon - did not work too well though, however still did contribute to Debt Pay Off.

*One thing i did differently*: I kept $5K as BS1 emergency fund because I was in a new country and was not feeling safe with just $1K (new country, new job).

*Next Steps*: I want to focus on the following in the order

1. BS3 ( 3months at least) Already have 5K need to save additional 5K.
2. A vacation. My family has not been anywhere for last 20 months, we moved into Canada waited for sometime and before we could plan a vacation we decided to start our Debt Free Journey. I would love to take my wife and daughter for vacation, even though small.
3. A CAR (nothing fancy). We have been using public transit for last 18 months. My office is near, however, on  random days my wife used to go for meetings 25 Kms on bus. Walking a 6 year to school, even though only a 2 KM walk, is not easy for a non native in Canadian winter.  

This would not have been possible without my Wife, daughter and family, Dave Ramsey's mentorship, YNAB (highly recommended for budgeting) and **THIS Community**.....

t3_b0gco6,Which debt should I pay first?,"TL;DR: My CC debt is $300, my other CC debt is $1200 but it is in my girlfriends name. Which should I pay off first assuming I could pay the $300 with my next paycheck.

Two years ago I had to get a pretty expensive car repair. Long story short, my girlfriends dad's advice was to see if I got approved for a credit card at the mechanic shop, and for his daughter to see if she got approved too. We both got approved, and we maxed out my card, and carried half the balance on hers to cover the bill. along the road we had to use hers again for another repair, bringing it to just shy of being maxed out.

After a year and a half of making minimum payments I started throwing any extra money at the debts. Now my personal credit card is down to $300 (30% the balance) and hers is 1200 ( approx. 50% balance) 

I have a couple questions. I could pay mine off with my next paycheck, then all that money I'd free up I could have hers paid off in 2 months. The problem is I'd feel guilty because even though it is all my debt, the card is in her name and I don't want it to seem like I'm playing some game or don't care about it. She doesn't know about Dave and I've tried explaining the debt snowball and she said it sounded ""silly."" She essentially came to the concept of the debt avalanche method on her own and I agree, you do pay less over time, but I like the idea of freeing up more money sooner so that I can go gazelle intense on the bigger debts. 

My other query is, if I get hers down to 30% of the balance, while kind of maintaining mine at sub 30%, wouldn't that boost our credit scores? So with that in mind, maybe I shouldn't be in a rush to pay mine off so soon?

Would appreciate everyone's 2c. Thank you!",0

t3_b07nyt,"Finding it awkward changing our mindset about ""pocket money""","TL;DR - Has anyone else found it challenging to give yourself permission to budget for (and actually **spend**) pocket money? 

When my husband and I started our journey in January 2016, we budgeted $40/month each (so $80/month) as ""fun money"". We rarely go out and neither of us has ever gone nuts buying tons of random junk we'll never use or anything like that. We did each keep one subscription (online game subscription = cheap entertainment) that was/is budgeted for separately.

We completed BS2 in July 2017 and BS3 in mid-late 2018. This year we've been working with a financial advisor to make sure we're making good decisions regarding investing for our retirement, and we'll likely have our home paid off late next year. We're 39 years old and will both turn 40 over the next two months.

Lately, we've started asking ourselves if we can/should start to relax a little with our pocket money. $40 a month doesn't go very far, and we made our peace with that a long time ago. Our average monthly take-home income is $5.2k. Other than our house, we've been out of debt with a stocked 6-month emergency fund for the last 3-6 months. 

The challenge that we're facing is entirely between our ears - we've been so focused on saving everywhere we can, that the idea of increasing our monthly pocket money allowance is kind of intimidating. It's like on some level it feels *wrong* to give ourselves more money to ""throw away"" on things that aren't essential. 

We talked for a long time about this last night and while we both said we were okay with the idea of increasing our pocket money allowance, neither of us wanted to commit to an amount. We both admitted it just feels awkward after three straight years of saying ""no"" to a lot of things. There is definitely a little preemptive guilt kicking around in our brains at the idea that more pocket money means it'll take an extra couple months to pay off the house, and my vehicle will need to be replaced in the next year or two, and so on and so on...basically, there will always be something that sounds more important than ""money to throw away on random stuff"", and that's messing with our heads.

Has anyone else felt this way? How did you deal with it? I'm not really looking for advice on how much pocket money we should allow (though suggestions are welcome), I'm more interested in the emotional side of the equation. Once you're debt free, or debt free minus the mortgage, and your emergency fund is stocked...how do you go back to letting yourself say ""yes"" more often, without feeling awkward or guilty?",0
t3_b0a65m,Questions,"1. Would you add your student loan to your debt free plan if you knew if you could waited longer, the rest of the loan would be forgiven?  Seems like I am going to be giving up free money.
2. If you have your budget ready and you have your budget for the next seven years planned with a mortgage paid off in 7 years, what would you do with unplanned windfalls here and there (I have a second job as a freelance photographer and do weddings part time)?

BACKGROUND - I bring home $5000 gross a month and have no children at home, $8,000 in credit cards that will be paid off in a year with snowball technique.  I have personal loans that will then be paid off June 2022.  I'll then work on three months of expenses.  I have a very steady job and a pension that will at least be what I make now based on my conservative calculations.  My daughter's college is already paid for because she is a bad ass and much better than her mother.  ",0

I could pay off my car within a month. However, I want to go back to seminary in the Fall to finish my degree. In an attempt to finish quickly, I'd like to save my money and not work while I go full-on with my studies. This means I would not immediately pay off my car but live on my savings for a year. Also, I would have my school paid for up front.

t3_b06t5h,"Underwater on car by ~13k, unsure of next step","Hey all!

My wife and I are working our way through BS2 right now and we are just about done with credit cards and will soon be tackling our car loan.
Background: My wife received some poor financial advice before we met and traded in her brand new car a year after she bought it and rolled her first loan into the next car loan, essentially owing 30k on a 17k car (brand new). We are trying to knock down our debt with that gazelle intensity, but we are unsure of the right step to make here. She already works two jobs and I pull as much OT as I can get so more jobs are not ideal. We are paying $520/month plus insurance with 5 years left on her loan. We have my paid off hooptie and another family members vehicle we have access to until we pay this off and find something reasonable we can pay cash for.
We would like to sell it as fast as we can, but being so underwater it seems our only real option is to take out a personal loan to pay it off, sell the car, then pay off the new loan. As much as we know that we aren't supposed to be accruing more debt, we wanted to get some input from this wonderful community. What do you all think is the right move here? ",0

t3_b038y2,My Situation,"Hi all. Here's my situation. I'm 23 and I have a salary that's $51,000. I started reading Dave's Total Money Makeover book last week and finished it in about 3 days because I was so intrigued. I was able to do step #1 and moved $1000 into a second Savings account that I was able to nickname ""Emergency Fund"".  I'm now on step #2. Here's my situation with my debt:

When I turned 18, I got my first credit card. Over the past 2 years I've gotten very ""credit card happy"" and now have a $29,000 credit limit across 9 different accounts. I have a Citi card (that's the one I got when I turned 18 because it was a ""college card"") then about 6 months later I got an offer from Capital One in the mail. And since then I've gotten a Chase freedom card, the Apple credit card, the Amazon card, the Microcenter card,  the Best Buy card, an American Express, and a Discover card. Why I thought I needed ALL these cards, I have no idea! Like I said. I got credit card happy. Luckily, out of that $29,000 limit, I only have about $4400 of it used. Roughly 15%. Also, I don't have any other debts, no student loans, no car payments. 

But here's the thing, I live in NYC, where the rents are outrageous. I rent a basement studio apartment in Queens that costs me $1345 a month, which does include utilities. At the end of the month, except for food expenses, I have about $1339 left over.  

Am I in a good spot here? I feel like I am. I've cancelled all of the unnecessary subscription (Hulu, Audible, YouTube premium) and now only have DirecTV now (which I may cancel...it's an extra $40 a month towards the snowball!), Spotify, and Netflix (I have 4 profiles and am splitting the $12.99 evenly so I only bay about $3 for it). 

Also, what should I do with the 9 credit cards I have once they're all 100% paid off? I know Dave recommends closing them, and I might; it'll wreck my credit score though.

We started SmartDollar in January. He’s been a little reluctant to our budget, but he’s slowly but surely getting on board. We’ve managed to get our emergency fund set up and have already paid $2,000 toward his student loan. 

I finally convinced him to cash out the whole life policy so we could each get term life (for less money). He cancelled it and was super giddy when he realized the $5,600 we’re getting can pay off his student loan and make a dent in our credit card. 

Now that we’ve paid off one of our debts in only a couple months, he has become a lot more motivated. We’re actively discussing our budget daily and he’s looking for even more ways to cut it down. We’re finally gazelles! ",0
t3_b02m06,(BS2) Repair or Replace? Long commute and big repair bill,"I drive a 2009 VW CC with 135k+ miles on it. I drive about 70 miles a day and spend about 2-2.5 hours in traffic in total. The car is paid for and KBB has it for $2000 private sale. I bought it in 2014 for $14k before we met Dave and financed it. Paid it off in 2017.

Last year we rebuilt the transmission for $4500 and then put another $1500 in mileage servicing throughout the year (replacing belts, filters, etc). The transmission was done by a repair shop and the mileage servicing was done by the dealer.

The brakes now need to be replaced and the heating coil is out. All told the bill will be another $1200-$1500. 

So here are my questions:

1.) Do I repair the car?

2.) How much car is reasonable for me to buy? Or how do you estimate how much car is reasonable? Husband doesn’t think it’s reasonable to drive a junker given how much I’m in the car. I’m on the fence.

Other notes:
We have approximately $20k in cash that we have been stockpiling for a “storm” we thought was coming but isn’t, so we can pay cash. 

To test the waters we went to a dealer yesterday to look at cars to see what a newer used version of my car costs and what they’d give me. There is a 2017 version of my car on the lot with 1100 (yes hundred) miles on it and all the creature comforts. They want $22k for it and will give me $3k for my car. I don’t want to justify spending more than I need to on a car.

Income: $85k/year.  Wife is unemployed currently.  Expected to get a 60-70k/year job soon.

Emergency fund:  $3k

Debt:

Just paid off the rest of student loans and credit cards last week.  So debt free besides the house and HELOC!

15k on 4.125% fixed 7 year HELOC.  Used to add new roof to house.  Just started last week snowballing $1k/month

170K left on house.  2.875% 15 year.   Valued at 420k.  Mortgage/insuarance/taxes at $1755/month

&amp;#x200B;

We were notified about 10 months ago that sewer will be aded to our street and we will be charged to pay for this.  Fully legal in our area. We are in urban unincorporated Washington County Oregon.   Construction is occurring now and we will be charged $24k once complete.   A lein will be put on our house and it will be financed through the water utility by default at 2% until we start making payments, then it increases to 4%.

We will also need to connect within 12 months of completion of the project.   Costs are expected to be $10k to decommission our septic tank and run a pipe 150 feet to the road.   We will also need to pay a $5,000 hookup fee.

So we are looking at about $39,000 to connect.   Talk about throwing money down the toilet!

Question is, would this $39,000 and $15,000 HELOC be considered as part of baby step 6 as its technically part of the house or baby step 2 as consumer debt?

I will be getting a $8-10k bonus  next month that i will be either applying to the HELOC or emergency fund.

I'd prefer to get our emergency fund started now to pay the non-financed portions (decommission, running pipe through my yard) in cash.

t3_azod87,“Manual Underwriting” questions and other questions when living without credit cards.,"Brief history: last year we had a ton of consumer/medical debt (50K), we sold our house and moved into rental and our debt is all gone (except student loans,  I’m cash flowing the remainder of my tuition, and loans are deferred until I graduate).  

We had to settle a bunch of our debt, and cancelled our credit cards, which feels great!  Now, we’ve encountered some friction since abandoning our credit cards/score.  For example, we couldn’t get into our rental until my parents co-signed with us because our credit is/was so bad and is still sinking.  

I went on a business trip last week and had to rent a car.  I discovered most places would only rent to those with a credit card, or debit card and a good credit score!  While sweating, I googled and found out Enterprise does rent to only debit card people as long as you have proof of a return flight, and they have a 20% deposit on top of your rental fee.

So my next hurdle on the horizon in about 2 years is potentially buying a home.  I did get the job I was traveling for!  It’s just for the summer, but will likely be where I go right after graduation.  I know Dave doesn’t care about credit scores, so I don’t want to either.  But unfortunately in this reality, tons of industries key on your credit score.  

Enter: Manual Underwriting.  Everyone I know keeps telling me their advice on how to quickly build my credit back up so I can be approved for a house.  But the thought of getting into credit cards to build my credit makes me sick.  

Can anyone who has done this walk me through the manual underwriting process?  What they are looking for?  How long does it take, assuming it takes longer than traditional underwriting?  What can I do in the next 2 years to make myself look as best I can to get the best rates?  So they use the same rates at traditional banks do?  

I have loved not having any credit card debt.  I don’t want to go back there ever again!  But I don’t know how to do some of this without a credit score.  

Thanks!

t3_azkyoe,Car selling question,"Hey guys a question I need some guidance on.

I’m gazelle intense right now.  Started in January and am getting ready to knock out my first debt fully / credit card debt.

Next comes the car.  I bought a used Jetta this past summer for 9500.  I owe 8300 on it now.  I am estimating I can pay between 12-1500 a month towards this debt and have it knocked out by October at the latest.  I also use this vehicle to drive Lyft, which has provided a boost in cash to throw at debts.

That said I owe a fully paid for albeit VERY old Truck that is drivable. This is my farm/beat around truck but I can drive it.

Beyond this I have student loans to tackle.  I owe 27,500...but I teach and am on my 3rd year.  Teach in my subject area for 5 I get 17500 forgiven. That is my current path.

The plan is when I get to my student loans to pay it down as fast as I can to that 17,500.  Then pile up what I would throw at that debt until I get to year 5.


So do I sell the car and drive my truck?? OR do I keep the car and keep using it.  I say it brings me about 6-700 extra a month driving after expenses.

t3_azmur3,What does Dave say about extremely high student loan debt?,"Going to give a hypothetical situation here. A person is in $165,000 of student loan debt and earns $80,000 a year.

So, what does Dave say when paying off the debt quickly is not realistic?

t3_azge7l,"Cash Envelopes, Sinking Funds, Settling Debt, and Savings Acct.","I am new to the Baby Steps/Dave Ramsey and am just getting started by reading/researching and taking an inventory of my debts. Lately I have been watching a lot of YouTube videos of people who do the Baby Steps/DR methods, and I have a few questions that I thought may be better answered in this forum.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. To those of you that use the cash envelopes and sinking funds - what do you do for things that are paid through direct debit or that require a debit card? For example, my car insurance is direct debited from my checking account each month - would I need a sinking fund for that? Also, I order all of my pet food/supplies from Chewy and use a debit card. This is something I think would be ideal for a sinking fund but I don't know how to do that with a debit card. Also, if you have a sinking fund for, say, Christmas for example, do you keep that as cash or in a savings account?

2. A few people I have watched on YT have settled their debt with creditors for 40% of the total amount owed and made a lump sum payment to get rid of the debt. Is this recommended? I am anticipating getting a tax refund and was thinking that I could use that to pay off one of my current debts. 

3. I would like to start a savings account for my Emergency Fund but don't want it tied to my current checking account so that I can't get at it as easily. For this reason, I am thinking of using a different bank.  What are the pros/cons of using a different bank than your primary bank for EF/Savings account? Are there any pluses to using online banks (I was thinking it would be easy to transfer money over but it might be too easy to take money out too).

t3_azgr5l,Need help figuring out my health insurance alternatives. Looking at healthcare sharing ministries mostly.,"Hello! 
To give a little background, I’m 24, married, healthy and rarely go to the doctor aside from checkups simply because I don’t need to. My teeth are pretty rough and I go to the dentist 2-4 times a year for things other than cleanings. I will also need some oral surgery (tooth extractions, gum grafts) and braces as soon as i can afford them (15k cash price total as I’ve been quoted). My mom quit her job and because of that, I’m no longer insured under her. My job’s insurance is far more expensive than I’m willing to pay at the moment. Finally, my wife and I are on BS4-6, currently saving up to buy a house. 

Healthcare is pretty new to me as I’ve never had to really worry about it before. It seems like the best route for me would be a healthcare sharing ministry, of which it appears there are several. I’m hoping to get some advice from others who have experiences with these ministries and find one that fits me pretty well.

So right now we are investing 8% in our 401k and wife is paying $80/month in HSA (we have been using it for medical bills). We have about 1500 in savings.

Right now we are putting 2000/month on the loan plus my bonus to get it paid off in 4-6 months. We keep the rest for ourselves for gas and cash for things we may want.  Then my goal is to tackle the student loans next. The cars don't concern me as much. But by the time the student loans are paid off car 1 will be. All we will have is my car and the house with around $3000/month left over.

But luckily we aren't in nearly as bad shape as most people who call Dave. 60k in debt with a gross income of around 120k is very doable. The wife and I are 29 by the way.

But does my plan seem sound? We could pay things off a tad quicker but with our income we want to eat out once a week isn't unreasonable is it?",0
t3_azg75j,Saving for College...how much?,"I'm a 35 year old that's planning to go back to college, and get a Bacholers in accounting.

I recently got past Baby Step 3 with 6 months of expenses saved up.  Right now, my excess is going towards saving in a separate ""college fund"", like an emergency fund for college related expenses.

The question is how much should I have in there?

I'll still be living in my apartment, and working my current full time job.  I'll also be applying for FAFSA, and seriously considering doing my first two years at a community college.

How much do you think would be a good amount to have in there?",0
