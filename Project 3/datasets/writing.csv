t3_bz6yns,The difference between a series and a book that never ends...,"So there's this thought that some writers have... and it's based on a false premise.

&gt; If I end my book with a question, the reader will want to buy the next one.

Now, there's a few reasons this thought can be okay, and a few reasons it's often not okay. 

## A Book Is A Promise

Ever taken a ride with a taxi driver or an Uber or even a friend who probably should have never been granted a drivers license and thought to yourself

&gt; By goodness, I'm never stepping foot into a car with that person again...

Think of a book like that, only it's a plane. There's a higher investment the reader is making in reading your words. So bringing them on a 12 hour cross-country flight and then informing them that you're actually not headed to the destination originally promised, and instead you're going to keep flying for another 12 hours -- well it wouldn't get a good response from the cabin.

Ending on a question is fine if your book landed the plane. A book is a promise, you need to show you delivered on that promise. If you don't, why would a reader want to buy the next book?


## Sequels Are The Way To Sell Books

False. 

In sheer publishing terms, the second book always always always sells less copies than the first. Now, while in theory this doesn't seem like such a crazy idea and you might be thinking ""By golly, my book is going to sell 1 billion copies so **some** of 1 billion isn't half bad...""

Well maybe it will. Maybe you have something that will sell a billion or a million or a hundred thousand copies. But one thing is for certain. A reader who reads a book that is the first in the series has two choices:

* Read the next book in that series. 
* Don't read the next book in that series.

Why does the first book ALWAYS sell more than the subsequent books? Because the first book is a **prerequisite** for all books thereafter. This may sound wonderful, but what it is is a problem. A big problem.

What it means is - if your book sells 10,000 copies... your publisher now knows factually that book two will sell less than 10,000 copies. Period. Granted, your second book may generate interest in the first for new readers, and it may up the total number of books sold. Heck, let's assume it gave your first book an outrageous 50% bump in sales because the readers who moved on to book two loved your first book so freaking much that they wanted the second, and they told all their friends and co-workers and 5,000 more people bought the first book to see what all the fuss was about.

Now we've got the following:

* Book 1 sold 15,000 copies.
* Book 2 sold 5,000 copies.

When a publisher thinks about this in business terms, they have two options. Sell less books than book one, or pick up a new standalone book or a new series that has the **possibility** of selling 100,000 copies... vastly outperforming your book, or worst case, probably selling like 10,000 copies (which is the net result of your Book 2 and increase in Book 1 sales).

You see the issue?


## So... I'll Just Write More Books In The Series!

Yes, but again, every single ending of every single book gives every reader you have the same options we had from book 1 to book 2.

* Continue reading the series.
* Stop reading the series.

If anyone... a single person... chooses the second option? You've now sold less copies of book 2 (which theoretically took just as long to write as book 1) than you did doing the same amount of work on book 1.


## But... But... Cliffhangers. 

Yes. Cliffhangers. These are perfect ways to show your reader you don't know how to land a plane, and they're perfect ways to convince them not to buy the next one.

Forget your writer brain for a moment. Think about your reader brain. Imagine you just watched a movie or read a book, and it ended, and it was nonsense. It resolved nothing. It ended and you had twice as many questions (see: plot lines) as it did when it began. 

I don't care how interesting those plot lines are. If the author cannot show me they can land a plane, I'm taking my parachute, I'm jumping out the nearest door or window, and I will not be buying that sequel. Why? Because the writer has broken their promise to me, that they know what they're doing, that they will EVENTUALLY give me resolution to all the questions I want answered so badly.

## The Important Bit

Because there's a difference between a story that makes you want to pick up the next book, and a story that just never ends. The first gives you RESOLUTION. The plane LANDS. You get out, you stretch your legs, you look around at the nice scenery and you go ""Yes. This is the destination I was hoping for."" And then the pilot gets on the horn and says -

&gt; Next flight is leaving in 200 days. Get ready! And here's a quick image of what you can expect -- this is where I'm taking you next.

That's a plane I want to ride.

**TLDR**: Don't write a series. It does not make you more desirable to publishers. But if you're going to ignore me and do that anyways... at least land the plane.",0
t3_bzaytk,Write one book or separate into two,I have story I’m working on that I feel like has a pretty solid story line. My issue is at times I feel like I need more from it. I’ve read that not every chapter is action packed but every chapter should still move towards the plot.  I planned all along to make a second book from this one.

t3_bz9iqx,"LPT: If you're a writer with ADHD, use voice typing!","Using voice typing provides an immediate feedback for your thoughts in the form of words on the page.

 This is extremely satisfying for people with attention deficit disorder, because it gives them the complete experience of seeing progress appear before their eyes. 

When you're struggling with writer's block, this is probably enough to snap you out of it.

 Not to mention, voice typing is much more efficient than a keyboard when it comes to coherently formulating ideas quickly on a page.

Thinking about where your fingers need to move on a keyboard just takes too much effort. 

Minimalizing the effort required to see progress instantly improves the ability to focus on what really matters.

 Otherwise, all the spare time between character inputs provides ample opportunity to get distracted with editing, or even an entirely different task.

I don't mean that you shouldn't be editing your work after writing everything down with voice typing, but this provides a fluid outlet for data and allows for somebody to harness the extreme stream of consciousness that they are stuck with on a daily basis.",0
t3_bz8qnk,Working through the lowest of lows.,"I've been through low points in my writing and toughened it out. Still kept my goal of one day getting my story published. Just keep working on it finished the first novel worked on the second after some editing waiting on beta readers. ETC.

&amp;#x200B;

But I've hit a point where I've lost the goal. Everything I've done for the past 3 years has basically been a waste. Everything I wanted to do moving forward is an exercise in futility. Series don't work for debut authors. They are hard sells for seasoned authors. I knew they were hard sells for debuts but to find out its impossible that my time was wasted. It's broken me. I honestly don't know if I will continue writing. (Sure AF didn't help that the group that dropped this bomb went. ""gtfover it. We are a positive group and don't offer pity"")   


I've declined invites from friends to game nights because I felt it drained my creativity. So instead I spent time working on my story. Because ""Hours and hours of pounding on your craft is how you hone it."" but that doesn't matter now. I've commissioned art to help promote my author platform and gain more followers but that's money I could have saved for a rainy day instead or spent to visit my grandmother or dying grandfather. I don't want to believe I've hit rock bottom but as it sits. I don't have a goal and I have no idea where to go or what to do next. I just. How do you writers get through these kinds of lows?

t3_bz8fk0,Starting a sentence with “But”?,"My mom was my first writing mentor. Most of her advice was grammatical, and one thing she said really stuck with me: never use the word “But” to start a sentence. Example: “It is true that, on the surface, men’s interest in maintaining the status quo may seem purely economic; de Beauvoir cites a male student who writes that ‘every woman student who goes into medicine or law robs us of a job,’ as if his right is self-evident. But the immaterial benefits of male dominance are far more insidious.” 

I always stop myself from doing it, but is there actually any truth to that rule? It always seems so convenient.

Edit: the example was just an example. In the paper I’m writing I started the second sentence with “however.” It was more of a general question than advice on that specifically.",0
t3_bz87d0,The Kanban Method for writers,"Just wanted to share something that could be used for y'alls productivity. I've never been the type of writer to have strict workflow processes. Hell, I found Scrivener to be overwhelming. But a week or so ago someone on reddit suggested this thing called the [Kanban Method](https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/what-is-kanban) and sure enough, there was a way to apply it in the [writing](https://myinnercreative.com/kanban-in-your-bullet-journal/) field. Since then, I feel my productivity has demonstrably increased and I can easily see how someone who writes longer pieces of fiction can use something like this for their benefit.

t3_byuk6r,What about an antagonist and protagonist that get along?,"While I don't think this is a particularly novel (ha ha) idea, I can't seem to think of any stories that I have read where there is a well done relationship built of mutual respect and *understanding*. Like where both characters are fully accepting of the other's motivations for what they do, but due to circumstances, personal agendas, etc, can't abide by the same principles.

I'm toying with the idea of writing a story that moves through large expanses of time with this sort of relationship being a central focus. 

Wondering what you guys think about such a dynamic, and if it's a worthwhile project? From where I'm standing, it looks like it might be a bit daunting to write just because it might be inclined to roll down a path of preachiness.",0
t3_bz5a9e,Is having journal entries written by the main character a form of lazy writing?,"So I'm writing a novel and in 2 or 3 sections I start the chapter out with a journal entry ""written by the main character"" which kinda summarizes what has happened over the past few days. Each entry is 1-3 pages long and then afterwards the chapter starts going along as usual. But is this lazy writing or something that should try to be avoided? The rest of the story isn't written like this but with those sections I needed to portray a change in mood over time but didn't wanna kill the pacing by writing pages upon pages of nothing super exciting happening and fill them with a bunch of stagnant conversations between characters just to subtlety change the tone over time. 

For example, in one part a blizzard hits and forces the characters into a building where they have to stay put until the storm clears. They end up trapped in the building and there is tension with not knowing if they have enough food, and not knowing what will come first between the storm stopping, and running out of supplies. I also wanted to make it clear that boredom was one of the things the characters had to struggle with as not having anything to distract yourself makes things like paranoia alot worse. So it is literally a section where the characters would just be waiting around essentially, but is still important as the effects of dealing with that situation is important later on in the story. 

So does anyone have any thoughts or advice? I guess having journal entries explicitly breaks the ""show don't tell rule"" but I also feel like ""showing"" the whole event would be detrimental to the pacing and add significantly to my end word count.",0

t3_bz9imj,Advice from you more experienced writers,"I own a business and part of what I do is write articles for my business blog. I'm a very average writer, but I want to dedicate the next 12 months to better my writing skills. I'm not expecting to be any kind of expert after just 12 months, but I hope to improve considerably.

So for the next 365 days, I will do each of these things every single day;

\- writing. write something every day.

\- reading. my question is about this point. 

\- learning. I've started with a course on Udemy and will continue to do courses throughout the 12 months.

My question to you is - I've been advised that reading some classic literature can help you become a better writer. I could just google a list of classic books but I thought I'd ask you for book recommendations to narrow the field a bit.

Do you have any suggestions for my new book list? Maybe the author has an interesting style or a way to capture a moment or a mood, or maybe writes in a poetic way.  I'm not sure really what I'm looking for in particular but if you have any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.",0
t3_bz4vco,The POV character should affect how you write a scene.,"Now this post is sparked by what I constantly see on the divide between sex scenes in erotica and non erotica. People say that it's written differently based on the genre. I disagree 110% with that sentiment.

Let's get another thing out of the way and that's a very simple fact. Regardless of character you have your own style for any given book but that's only part of the story, it's only part of the pie. You have your writing style, your book style(kid, YA, adult, wtvthefuck) and then you got your character style. I think letting the character take the biggest slice of the pie will lead to far more organic writing. It will fit better and it will be doubly powerful when you switch POVs, especially between contrasting individuals.

What do I mean by HOW a scene is written? I mean everything. Pace, word choice, what you detail, what you focus on and so on. It's basically all the little puzzle pieces that make up the bigger picture entitled ""SCENE"". There are some obvious caveats I'll add at the end of this post.

So the best way to showcase this is with examples, let me hit you with some o' dat:

*  Let's take the act of killing as an example by using two contrasting personalities. A cold blooded killer who does what he does with a very businesslike mentality will not be enjoying the crunchiness of someone's skull, he may not even pay attention to it so it's not even going to show up in your writing really. A passing mention at best and little more. The killing will tend to be fairly flavorless. Now if we contrast this with a maniac that loves to kill and savor every one of his victim's demise will be the exact opposite. This character may grunt, exhale sharply and maybe even moan. Who fucking knows. Your writing will be tinted red as you describe the savoring of every little moment and every drop of blood.

* An obvious one would be sex too. What is sex to your character? Is it just a bodily function? Sort of a well that needs to be drained? Is it a moment of immense passion, lust and love? Is it a coping mechanism? How experienced is this character? Has he banged so many women that he could find his way in a dark room without even knowing there's a woman in there? Or is this his first time and he may even be confused as to where the holes are? There's numerous facets to this matter such as experience, outlook on sex and on any given partner. A supremely experienced man is gonna have a very different sex scene compared to a virgin. One that uses sex as a coping mechanism will be focused on trying to get all that venom out of his mind even if for just a moment. The dude chasing a nut will just bang until he's done and then he's done. The sexual guru is gonna make his woman shiver at every touch and everything he does because that's what he wants. He's not chasing the nut. He's chasing the goal of female transcendence and levitation through sex.

* What about just ordinary day to day life? I had this moment of brilliance where I switched between one of the BADDEST men in the city to one of the MEEKEST men in the city. The former is greater than life. He's respected, beloved and feared whereas the latter feels an oppressive atmosphere wherever he turns. Everything and everyone just feels like it crushes him into a little ball. And that reflects on the writing. The latter's narration is very meek, pathetic and there's a strong sense of victim mentality in there. The former's narration is no questions, no doubts and no hesitation(for the most part). He's sure of his actions and his hands don't shake for even a split of a millimeter as they make their way towards some unfortunate loser's throat.

These are good enough examples to showcase the point I'm trying to make. There's tons of variability and this is where you need to have a strong grasp on your characters(which is happily my strong suit). Just think about it. What would this character be focusing on in this scene? How would they carry themselves through it? And the answers to those(as well as several others) will lead to a scene being crafted.

Now as for the caveats:

* The situation is a strong point. If we take the killer example for instance. In the middle of a massive battlefield, the fruitcake who loves murder and mutilation isn't going to really get the opportunity to savor every little crunch of bone. BUT the situation may fuel some sort of blood rage or just pure stupid blood lust. Y'know there's just SO MANY people to kill, it's like a carnival event of sorts where you pay once to enter and then you can knock yourself out to your heart's content doing whatever the fuck to whoever the fuck(some friendly fire is not entirely traceable in a chaotic battlefield wink wink). Now this is a sliding scale. There's many things between a one on one and a full scale blown out battle so don't be stupid. Don't write a fist fight one on one the same way you write a genocidal last battle.

* The people involved will also affect how the scene goes. The perfect way to showcase this is with the sex example. Let's say the partner is just a hooker. Just a hooker you pick up off the corner and that's it. She's there for the money and the dick, she can take it or leave it(now mind you I'm not proficient in the art of banging prostitutes so I have no clue if there's a universal rule about them.(Just like everything else people are different so I can leave that to your creativity. Maybe she'll cuddle you or she'll give you her number instead of charging you(Because you're that much of a Chad). Who knows. You figure that shit out but I'll run with the I don't give a fuck gimme the money type of hooker)). That shit may be on a timer and once it's over all of her moans all of a sudden vanish and she's asking for her 500 bucks. But let's take this further. Maybe the guy is treating her as someone to grind sexual XP on. He's as much about business as she is so he's not shocked as opposed to the dude who lowkey fell in love with her and is trying to purify her heart or something.

* My writing is very character based. It's not plot or world based. Depending on the story the sliding scales will look differently but the character scale will always have a much larger piece of the pie. I simply don't have that much interest in spending 10 paragraphs describing a fucking building or a city or something. That's why I don't bother worldbuilding boring crap like realistic geography or economies. These things just aren't interesting to me. Economy will be there(Fuck realistic geography. FUCK THAT NOISE) but I have no intention of going balls deep into that topic. I'm also playing to my strengths which are characters and their interactions. I'm not proficient with the language to write 50 word sentences with no period and have it all make sense or make it an enjoyable read in any regard. My writing tends to be on the punchier(rhythmic if you will) side with extreme focus on characters. So in other words, tinging your writing heavily with the POV character may not be for everyone. It SHOULD(no discussion) be there regardless but how much is more dependent on you and your proficiencies.

This post may feel like it's just the skeleton of something much greater but there's no fucking way I'd be able to showcase every little combo and every little example with a goddamn reddit post of all things.

t3_bz2me5,The brilliance of the Harry versus Voldemort story-character-plotline-duality and circularity,"Harry is in the main protagonist.

Voldemort is the main antagonist.

The protagonist's ***greatest strength***, his willingness to die to save his friends and Hogwarts, is the antagonist's ***greatest weakness***, his unwillingness to die, thus Voldemort's ultimate seeking for immortality and that's all rolled into his seeking of a way to kill Harry *because* Harry, by prophecy, is the only one who can kill Voldemort.

This circularity begets itself...

Harry's ***greatest weakness*** (a.k.a **fatal flaw**, or Achille's heel) is his ""anger and occasional arrogance"" as stated by Rowling. But this becomes his ***greatest strength*** to ultimately overcome Voldemort. On the flipside, Voldemort's ***greatest strength***, arguably to cause fear or instill fear, becomes his own **fatal flaw** — in that Voldemort's greatest fear (again, arguably) is himself lying dead at Harry Potter's feet, and in order to prevent this he goes after Harry again and again, which of course leads to exactly his greatest fear becoming a reality. (In that way, Voldemort foreshadows and causes his own demise.) 

Plus, all of this character moitivation and duality of strengths and weaknesses fleshes out and comes to its inevitable yet surprising face-to-face conclusion in the final **climax** of the whole story. This is how you combine character and plot. 

Do your protagonist and antagonist mirror each other?

One has free control over the processes of Fission and Fusion, and the only way I can think to describe it is what a nuclear reactor meltdown would be like without anything containing it. It creates an intense explosion that is unimaginably loud, bright, and hot. I'm not sure that's what would actually happen from smashing atoms apart though. Nuclear elements sure, but I don't actually know what happens when you smash the atoms of everyday things on a large scale. I know there would be a huge heat explosion do to the energy, but would it actually explode like a thermonuclear device?

The toughest one is the main antagonist. Her power is 4th dimensional shifting. I don't even know how to describe that.

Any ideas?",0
t3_bz7dal,I need some advice on an outlining situation,"Hey everyone I am trying to finish my novel and I got up to 36 chapters. But my problem is I wrote without an outline and just wrote what I felt and the story went that way. So I went back to do a ""reverse outline"" where I created a document listing what happened in every scene of each chapter. For example, ""Scene 1:x and Scene 2 Y"" with the chapter number listen on top of it. I tried taking it to my writing group a few months ago and they offered me no suggestions on which scenes to cut out and which to keep. Ive been stuck ever since. Sadly it took me 5 years to start writing this novel and I wrote 35 chapters from January-December because I was taking a special project class at my college. But you can only take this class 2 times for credit so I did in spring 2018 and had 7 chapters written. Did 11 last summer and got halfway through 35 when the semester ended. I was writing like one new chapter per week. But unfortunately the past 6 months I hit a wall. I feel like I want to clean up my first 35 chapters and revise them with the group notes then move on and write a new outline for the last 10 or so chapters and follow that. I feel like I have lots of scenes that I enjoyed writing but that may or may not seem like necessary. My problem now is I don't know what is and what isnt necessary. Everything I wrote feels interesting to me though. Another problem I have is possibly too many subplots. Any suggestions?",0

There are some ideas that I have that once they are firmly in my mind I cannot change them afterwards. Things like a character's name for instance. My current project started as a daydream scenario I had at work about a girl with a motorcycle traveling through a quasi futuristic wasteland. A song I had heard recently ""Little Dark Star"" was the basis of my premise for her. She had unusual gravitational powers that I only had a loose idea of how they worked. Before she even had a name I imagined a showdown between her and a character named Lux that had telekinesis and the power of flight. This encounter would see both characters injured for the first time in their lives, and would leave a monorail track spanning a waterway completely destroyed.

There were things I knew I was not going to be able to alter. The characters' powers, and the name Lux. She had no defined appearance or personality, but her name was going to be Lux.

Oddly once I settled on a name for the original girl (Lira) I quickly realized that Lux was going to be the primary protagonist. In fact Lira meets an early fate, but has a legacy that carries through the entire story.

The scene I imagined of Lux breaking Lira's arm in a violent retaliation set the tone for the whole thing.

The problem is, for a lot of the plots to unfold, time needs to pass.  We do step A, but then need to wait 3 or 4 months for the results to unfold, then take an action ... then wait another couple months.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I can try to play around with this a bit, like Step A happens around the same time a character tells her husband she is pregnant, now we move to the birth of the child and are seeing the results of Step A.  So the reader can sort of see that time has passed.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions would be: if this jumping of time is needed for the story, is that kind of a red flag that it might be a bad story to begin with?  Aside from knocking-up characters and injuring them and having them heal from injuries, it's quite difficult to pass the time without just starting ""Chapter 4: Six Months Later"".  Are there any other tricks of the trade that can pass time?  is it *lazy* to just start sections out ""Six months later""?

t3_byk2mj,This is what I've been doing since I was a teenager and it's helped me enormously when writing dialogue.,"I've been keeping a massive file both on my phone and laptop of all interesting, engaging, clever pieces of dialogue I come up with when I day dream or when I speak to others. This includes comebacks, one liners, original jokes and expressions, insults, monologues, intense exchanges, word plays etc. I have been writing these on my phone as soon as the idea would pop in my head. As quick as possible since it's ridiculous how quick one can forget a good idea. I also add other interesting, clever, uncommon expressions, phrases, quotes etc that I hear from people in real life situations (obviously never from films, music etc). 

After so many years, I compiled a massive document full of all my original ideas and other brilliant quotes. When I write dialogue, I look to incorporate those and expand on them. It's similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle, having hundreds of pieces that you need to figure out where to place. It helps my dialogue sound natural as well because if I use a line/quote from the file, I have to write dialogue by responding to it, just like in a real life conversation. I definitely noticed that it sounds more genuine than when I write dialogue by imagining the whole conversation in my head as I go. 

In addition, maintaining such a collection is a life saver when going back to review my work and I notice dull, boring dialogue bits that need a bit of spice but I can't come up with anything on the spot.

Basically, time begins with one creator, who has five of his own children in addition to creating life and land. His three middle children kill him, then after a war between those three, they raise a big mountain range like an upside down T, diving the continent into three parts, one for each to rule. The youngest son disappears to plot revenge for his father and the oldest daughter disappears to mourn. The middle three children have children of their own, and a prophecy occurs at the birth of twins from the youngest daughter. World events are heavily influenced by the gods and their children, and so I tried to find a good tool where I can have like text boxes that connect the events to people and gods, but came up pretty short. I tried post it notes on my relatively big bathroom mirror, but ran out of space and found it hard to connect the events and people.

t3_bywezr,Writing in English as a non native English speaker,"This question is probably not asked very often...

Do you think it is realistic? I would say that my English is decent enough, but it is far from perfect and I especially lack ""fine literary vocabulary"", even though from the point of understanding it I'd say I'm practically at the native level as I've been living in an English speaking environment for the past ten years.

There are some nice online tools that help me correct my grammar, but I still feel that my English often sounds a bit unnatural and without an editor checking the text it would be ""unsuitable for consumption"" by people.

On the other hand I find it fun reading (I've been reading since I was a child every day) and writing simple ideas from time to time.

Well, I guess you can judge my English level based on the writing above. That's more or less how I would normally speak in English and equally how my written English looks.

t3_bz3zcm,"Regarding head hopping - what defines a ""scene?""","I am trying to rid my novel of head hopping - showing multiple characters' interior mind thoughts in a single scene.

The advice is to limit the narrative ""interior mind"" thoughts to one character in any given scene.  It's ok to switch to a different character, but not until a scene ends.

So, what constitutes a scene?

Let's say chapter fifteen of a novel is a straightforward chapter, without any mid-chapter break.  2,000 words, start to finish, nothing fancy.  The chapter describes a grocery shopping trip in which a husband and wife go together.  Let's also say that while they are in the store, the husband makes his wife angry.    

The chapter starts in the couple's driveway, with the car backing out of their garage.  The first sentence is ""James shook his head as he backed down the drive, already dreading the trip to the store with his wife.""  So, we are immediately seeing the internal mind of the husband.  

The chapter moves forward, chronicling the car ride to the store, the events in the store, and the car ride back.  When they reach their driveway at the end of their trip, the chapter ends.  

Regarding head-hopping, and given the chapter is straightforward without any breaks, is that one scene or three?  For the purposes of avoiding head hoppings is it ""car/store/car"" (three scenes) or is it ""trip"" (one scene) ??

If it is one, I must keep the ""interior mind"" narration to the husband throughout the entire chapter, as that's how it started.  If it is three, I can switch the narration of the third part - the drive home - to the interior mind of the pissed-off wife, which is what I want to do.  

What do you think?  Thanks.",0

t3_byyuwu,"Tricky: Your MC's greatest desire (what basically drives them through the whole story) is also their greatest weakness (and, perhaps, becomes their greatest strength?)...","Great characters are often known for **their fatal flaws**, and sometimes, that fatal flaw (loosely defined as their big weakness) is tied intimately to their core motivation as a character which is itself tied to the climactic obstacle of your story. When your hero is down-and-out, broken and seemingly defeated, brought to their knees before the ultimate villain, shamefully drunk at the love of their life's wedding to their best friend, it is often that hero's **fatal flaw** which is being exposed and exploited. 

But that fatal flaw is also tied to their great drive, desire, or **core motivation** as a character. 

For instance: 

1. Your MC wants nothing more than to marry the love of her life, but she can't for x, y, z reasons (one of those reasons being that your MC also loves to party hard all night long!) — and what more (increasing tension and conflict) that love of your heroine's life chooses to marry none other than her best friend and —*what more* — she's asked to be the bride's maid at the wedding! Omg. Time for your MC to get rip-roaring drunk and embarass themselves! :D
2. The most powerful weapon in the universe haphazardly lands in your hero's lap, but your hero's just a thirty-something bagger at a grocery store — what can a loser-at-life possibly do with the most powerful weapon in the universe? Well, when a crazy galactic overlord zips in to steal the weapon for their own terrible purposes and — *dear God no!* — blow up the grocery store thereby rendering your MC jobless (how will they ever pay off those student loans now?), your MC ends up utilizing their ""mad bagging skills"" to overcome the overlord and save the grocery store and destroy (or use) the weapon for the greater galactic good. 

Anyone got other examples? 

(Note: ""Fatal flaws"" here are loosely defined as character's weak points. There can be a stricter definition, such as the Achille's heel, where the fatal flaw has ultimately tragic (hence, *fatal*) consequences for your MC. But for this post's purposes, I think a fatal flaw can include weaknesses, strengths disguised as weaknesses, phobias, delusions, terrible secrets, etc.). 

Plus it's kind of a storytelling trope that any protagonist with a big weakness can ultimately overcome that weakness (or turn that weakness into a strength) and *use it* to save the day, or their marriage, or whatever. 

It's also important to note that writing prompts and story pitches often use this catchy fliparoo of folding your character's fatal flaw into their core motivation and plot.)

\*\*\*\*\*\* 

So, **recap**: Roll your protagonist's fatal flaw into the plot through the antagonist's exploitation of that fatal flaw at the moment of the climactic obstacle, then have your protagonist ultimately overcome the antagonist by (also) overcoming their fatal flaw (turning their weakness into a strength) and using it to defeat the antagonist or antagonistic forces. Additionally, your protagonist's core motivation drives them into this fliparoo — something along the lines of your antagonist, at the moment of climax, standing and gloating over your protagonist, saying something like: ""Isn't this what you've wanted all along?"" right before you protagonist suffocates them with a plastic grocery bag. :)

\*\*\*\*\*\*

I’m currently in the process of writing a book. I’ve never written a book before but I plan to self-publish with Amazon Kindle.

I’m curious what “editing” actually entails. Is it simply proofreading and voicing perhaps? Or does it also include rewriting an entire paragraph because the writer may have failed to communicate their point smoothly.

I’m an excellent writer, however, writing this book has also made me lazy at times. Thus I feel like some of my portions could use a little redo.

Thus, when I hire an editor will they cover that? Or just do grammar edits?

Is it acceptable (if I eventually get to the stage of being able to submit to a publisher) to defer to the publisher on this by saying it could be either/or: Adult Epic Fantasy, or YA Fantasy, their choice? 

&amp;#x200B;

Are the publishers going to pass on any query letter that doesn't specify the exact genre of the book?

t3_byq76f,Choosing a name for a character,"I'm Spanish and I'm writing a novel in my language.

The English word is written with ""Ch"", so at the beginning I was going to name it just like that. But then I realised everyone who read it and didn't speak English (or even people who speak English but don't think about it) would pronounce it as a Spanish ""Ch"" (like in ""chat"" or ""catch""), when in that word CH is pronounced as K, so I thought maybe I could use another letter.

I’m in the very early stages and I’m trying to make a motive for my villain, but it involves time travel and I can’t figure one out with the points I’ve already set up:

• Villain witnesses the defeat of his future self (not knowing who it was) by hero from future (this is one of the first scenes)

• At the end of the story, Villain goes back in time to the beginning of the story

• Villain succeeds in his goal

• Villain is defeated by the hero that chased Villain back in time

• Timeline loops and isn’t altered

This is probably the wrong way to go about this, but I’m new to this so general advice is also appreciated. I’d love to have these points in the final story, but I get if it’s simply not possible. Here’s my problem. If the villain’s future self succeeds in his ultimate goal, what’s the present villain’s motivation for going to the past at all? If it’s something like killing the king, the king would die early in the story and the villain wouldn’t have a reason to go back in time and kill him. Maybe completing his goal had the side effect of creating the event that turned him into a villain in the first place (family dies, etc.)? Maybe future villain completed the goal but present villain didn’t know? These are just a couple ideas that may work, but I’d love to hear other suggestions and/or how to pull these off.

Idk it could be because I feel like I'm not taken seriously by the people around me so it makes me feel like my writing is embarrassing or not as serious as I think.

t3_byjatu,"Planners, what do you do when you find out late in the game that keystone elements of your work aren't viable?","I've been writing for quite some time now, learning by writing different pieces and putting together a large project. Long-term, I wanted to make my own Marvel-esque comic book universe.

Unlike Marvel, I wanted all the events in the various installments to be consequential instead of disposable. To that end, I planned to have the entire work be going toward a massive climax. The idea was to set up a bunch of different plot threads and and elements across years of storytelling, and eventually it would all come together in a gigantic superhero/giant robot battle against an alien invasion. But it's become increasingly apparent that this will never work.

It would be easy to remove if any of this was just a random element done for the sake of coolness. But it's not. This entire thing was the crux of nearly all of the plots, essentially acting as a pair of super-arcs merging together into an even-huger arc. Without it, most of the faction's and characters' actions have no cause, the heroes are left without an origin, technologies will have no cause to be created, my main hero will have an important part of his arc never happen, and the entire comic universe will be building toward nothing.

So how does one recover from a setback this massive?",0
t3_byp3ee,How to refer to a character who can appear as anyone?,"In my novel, my main character has these vivid dreams in which she's visited by an ancient goddess that can change their appearence to her 'deepest desires and fears'. 

In one dream the goddess appeared as the man my MC loves, and then in another as her dead brother. At first, MC isn't aware of the origins of this shape shifter/appearance taker, and thus I refer to it as an 'evil spirit' in writing, but later my MC finds out it's actually an ancient goddess trying to manipulate her.  

Now that she knows this information, how do I refer to the goddess in my writing? Even though the goddess knows that MC knows who she really is, she still takes on the form of her brother to torment her, so whenever the goddess does something (shrugs, walks, etc) it looks like the brother is doing it. How would I write this without constantly saying 'She looked at her through his eyes' or 'She spoke with his voice'. Calling it a spirit was easy as it was genderless and I could refer to it as 'they', but now that MC knows it's a goddess (female) taking on the form of her brother (male) it's becoming a little harder for me to refer to it without confusing the reader.

Any tips? It's told in a third person (close) POV.",0

t3_byinmw,How to create my writer career?,"I'm writing a main story which I was creating a little over 1 year in my head and finally some time ago I decided to write it, some time ago I was thinking about just writing as a hobby and I am still working on it but when I'm writing it I wonder if Could I have a career as a writer ?, I would like to have one since I have fun writing the story.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to that main story, I have several stories that I have only been able to write a brief summary of her, some simple ideas that could become stories

&amp;#x200B;

These days I have started to think that I would like to have a career as a writer, my economy is bad, I live with my parents and I would like to do something with my life, I know this is a very difficult race almost impossible but I would like to try it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was thinking about writing a different story while I write the main one (I mean writing 2 stories at the same time), I don't know if it is possible but I would like to publish the first one on websites like webnovel or others to see how people react to my stories and the second story I would like to save it as a draft for a while until I have much more experience to edit it and so I can publish it.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, I would like go to publish stories to create a name or career for myself and, on the other hand, to continue working on my main story until one day I think I have experience well enough to finally publish it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is this: Is it okay to do so or is there any advice you can give me?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like my family to see me differently, not only as a lazy guy, maybe I should not have so much hope in this almost impossible race but I feel that I have not even tried it for give me surrender

&amp;#x200B;

The truth, some time ago I began to have depression due to family problems that have arisen around me and the writing has helped me to temporarily flee from that bad environment and enter ""my world"" to concentrate on writing and momentarily ignoring my problems and i have peace of mind with those hobby times.

I just want to have a quiet life and if a career as a writer can give me it, I would be happy to head to that pool

Ok I admit it I am stuck at the climax of my story which involves a raid on a militarised research lab to rescue my MC.

I had the idea that they could knock out the power supply to the building to take out security cameras and other security measures. But then I got stuck on how they might do that? I didn’t think it likely that one junction box would do it and the one they want might be hard to get at. Then the base might have its own sub station but how would my rescuers disable that? Preferably without having to smuggle a bomb in. Then there might be a back up generator which they would also have to take out…

If anyone has any experience of writing about this sort of thing I would be most grateful for some help.

Now, it's not as bad as it sounds--I do have a basic premise plot-wise, and I know where I want my characters to end up by the story's finish, but there's no actual... direction. I have character development plotted out, but I don't actually know what the big action and events are going to be. It's kind of a disaster, I know.

Without too much detail, it's basically about two rival kingdoms, a corrupt third party pulling the strings behind these kingdoms, and a mysterious omen that prophesies of war and a collapse in power. I know my main gang of characters are going to discover the corruption going on and try to expose it/learn of the prophecy and try to keep the information it provides from, you know, ruining society and starting a huge war. I'm just struggling to turn these ideas into anything cohesive.

So, do I just give up on this story? I really don't want to--I'm super proud of the ideas and atmosphere surrounding it and I want to create something with it, but I also want to deliver a story and plot that's actually interesting. How to I create a unique/interesting plot out of a universe I've created? I've been stuck in this rut for awhile now, and I need advice.

I mean first off, it's just buying into the hypermasculine pseudomilitaristic productivity culture bullshit that governs the business world -- the four hour workweek, hack-your-life kinda shit.

Currently I'm about thirty pages into a third draft, and it's taking forever, and ya know what? I'm kind of content to let it take its own time. Whenever I try to force the write-a-thousand-words-every-day thing, it's a thousand words that don't help me at all. I find that I have periods that are more productive and great, and periods that are just pretty useless, and there's no way for me to ""force"" it. Half my writing sessions are just confronting confusions that arise as a result of the fiction, and then typing out a conversation to myself in an attempt to solve those problems, but also I sometimes don't type anything at all. 

I broadly understand the write-every-day discourse attempts to get dreamers and schemers off their asses and actually making progress on their ideas.

It has two lead characters, one of which is a sarcastic, 20-something, leather jacket-wearing alcoholic who makes bad life choices and has super powers. About five years into writing, Netflix puts out Jessica Jones... a show about a sarcastic, 20-something, leather jacket-wearing alcoholic who makes bad life choices and has super powers. I even had an idea for a sequel where my character meets a guy who can control minds who manipulates her into a relationship. Obviously, that idea was out the window. I did still finish writing and self-publishing the book, as it the co-lead and the storyline made it different enough. But it was frustrating that I had put so much of myself into this character, only to have her show up on TV before I could get my own story finished.

And before I had even finished that book, I had an idea for another one: a teenage girl was born on a spaceship headed to colonize a new planet. Her ship is the second ship to arrive, and when they're still a few years away, they get a message from the first ship: S.O.S. They're headed into some unknowable danger, and can't turn back.

I really liked the idea. Thought it was a great hook. Have been writing it intermittently for the past three years. And then this week I read Charlie Jane Anders' *The City In the Middle Of the Night*, and it's virtually the same story, but written better than I could have. The premise is slightly different - her book is set on a planet humans settled centuries ago, where things are just starting to fall apart. But her story and mine are both (spoilers for Anders' book, not mine, although every plot point is the same): &gt;!a teenage girl who's in love with her best friend and otherwise feels isolated from society makes contact with aliens, who the other humans are terrified of. The aliens live in a collective and communicate telepathically, and realizes that the way for humanity to move forward and survive on the planet is to assimilate with the aliens instead of trying to keep human society the same as it was on Earth.!&lt; Like, beat for beat the same story.

I'm not even asking for advice, as there's nothing I can really do except move on to the next idea. Anders started her book well before mine, I started mine before hers was published, it's just one of those things. But it's happened to me twice now, and it's starting to get annoying!

Not saying I'm a genius, I'm basically a chimp in the mathematics department. But I have always been gifted with making people see and feel things by writing on a piece of paper. 

Way I see it, the only way I'm going to get out of the blue collar workforce is if I can use my talents to create my own stories that people love. That is my dream. It just recently became my dream because it was in the back of my mind dormant for years. 

I have written many things. I've written horror, science fiction, fantasy, and even a couple pornos just for shits and giggles. I want to create something everyone loves.

The only problem is, I know there are so many aspiring writers who go unnoticed and become starving artists. I won't be able to do this unless it becomes my occupation. I have a family. 

So, if I was to write a complete masterpiece, how would I get that out and get it noticed by someone important ? How would I make a career out of this ?

t3_by6b64,Writing with an accent?,"Hey /r/Writing

I am writing a story in a fantasy setting, where a dwarf has some lines.

But I have doubts - is this ever something writers do (write with accent)?

t3_by75fk,Your voice or refined voice?,"I saw a recent post—perhaps a comment—that made me wonder: *is a speaking voice the voice for my work?* Now, it didn’t actually make me think this, because I have my own opinion on the matter, but let’s go with it.

Is writing like you speak a good idea? 

Well, some, maybe many, would say yes. “This is how you make your voice unique.” I might even need to slap an exclamation point in that quote, the way people talk about it. Yet, do any of us actually write like we speak? And even if we did, would it be any good?

Writing is the reduction of thought. You can call it boiling, refining, you can even call it reducing (I just did), but the fact of the matter is: it’s not how we speak. It’s better than how we speak. That’s the whole damn point.

And for that matter, if anyone could write like they spoke, edit into something coherent, and jump off the page, then anyone could do it.

So here’s my opinion:

Your writing voice isn’t your voice. It’s your *learned* voice. It’s the one that’s birthed from reading, writing, and generally working at the craft. Using the bits of authors you love, plus the self-learned insights, with a dash of efficiency from editing. It’s developed and refined over time. 

I think that writing exactly as you speak is a step towards having your writing voice. Until you can write freely, you’re nothing. But then you find flaws, find words you hate, find words you overuse, find stylistic stuff from other authors that you understand and love, and after putting it into practice for too many years, you have your voice. You can write with little edits, in a clear and concise way, and it is you. Unequivocally your version of learned and loved bits. 

This is your voice.

If you’re not there yet, that’s fine. Much like you’ll see repeated a thousand times on a slow day here on r/writing, just keep writing. Eventually it will come to you. And when it does, you’ll know it.

The only exception is writing in first person. And that’s a whole new monster. You have to write in *someone else’s* voice. Not yours. A character’s. And even that wouldn’t be how the character spoke. It would be a *reduction* of their thoughts. Somehow unequally theirs, even if written by you.

That’s how I feel, anyway. Discuss below.",0

t3_by51vy,How to deal with a morally superior antagonist,"Context: I'm currently writing a supernatural story with elements of Lovecraftian horror and a setting similar to that of the SCP Foundation. The antagonist is trying to prevent an apocalypse through killing all the people who are destined to end the world and by forcing humanity into a Garden of Eden-esque existence. Essentially, utopia without free will. It's a fairly by-the-books 'the end VS. the means' conflict. The problem I'm having is that the antagonist is a better person than the protagonist in every way.

&amp;#x200B;

The antagonist's allies are their friends, each of whom they helped out at some point in their lives. For example, a gifted magician in severe debt whom the antagonist saved from execution at the hands of the mafia. Meanwhile the protagonist is working with terrorists and sociopaths responsible for tens of thousands of deaths, just one of whom kills over nine hundred people in a week, while the combined kill count of every antagonist is maybe just over fifty. Further, the end of the story revolves around the protagonists' attempt to stop the cataclysm from coming early, but the antagonist is the one who ultimately performs a heroic sacrifice and dies in order to save their friends and family. Meanwhile, the protagonist is only trying to stop the antagonist because their mother is one of the people who inadvertently causes the apocalypse.

* Write whatever you like - at least 500 words and no more than two pages per story (or come up with your own rules).
* There is a list of ""additional restrictions"" to choose from for even more of a challenge.
* I've provided customizable spreadsheets to track your progress and set down rules.

**It's all about breaking the cycle, of finishing something in order to prove to yourself that success is possible.**

t3_bxpgie,Having problems with your characters constantly sighing and shrugging (and other gestures)? Here are a few things to think about and ask yourself.,"So this post was inspired by this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bxi7cf/im_currently_reading_the_wise_mans_fear_someone/

In which a reader is a bit fatigued by how Patrick Rothfuss overuses characters 'shrugging.' I've only read Name of the Wind myself so I can't comment on it. 

Anyway, the problem readers have with overusing particular gestures is pretty clear. Readers crave variety, and repetition wears out quickly. But I think there is more to the problem than just repetition. 

To start with here are a few features of scenes / contexts in which 'too much shrugging' can be a problem:

- They are generally 'in scene' beat by beat dialogue scenes. Ie. Shown, not told. (This isn't a problem in itself, but it doesn't really happen in exposition or 'telling')

- They are usually formatted as: [Dialogue / Action tag / Dialogue / Action tag / Dialogue ....] In order to show the reader who is speaking. Most, if not all, dialogues will have tags.

- There is usually some impulse to show pauses and gaps in the conversation, perhaps when one party is speechless or has no comeback. Therefore the gap is filled with a shrug, or a sigh. 

- The writer may put the action tag 'shrugs' or other gestures in there because the dialogue doesn't carry the weight of the scene well enough.

***The following are some ideas to consider. (And not prescriptive rules or editing checklists.)***

[DISCLAIMER: If you are a master of action tags and your action tags are the best and you are already perfect there's no need to respond with an essay on why action tags are the best. You do you. This advice is aimed at people who are having problems with repeated gestures and action tags. If you are not having problems, or if you think action tags are the bees knees, then there is no need for you to take this advice in any way. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.] 

___

**One: Re-think your use of action tags.**

Action tags are a great tool, and used correctly they can inject a lot of useful and impacting information in a relatively short space. **However, this is my belief: If every line of dialogue has a unique action tag, none of them are unique.** The point of uniqueness should be emphasised by *some* dialogues having action tags, and most not having them. Use this contrast to make the gestures really punchy. You can't turn every instrument in an orchestra up to 11 and expect the listener to make sense of anything, and it's the same in writing. 

Emphasise things by using them rarely. I encourage you to think this way about action tags. Something I see way too often in dialogue excerpts from the newer writers on this sub is that they'll write a scene like this:

&gt;""So is that the money?"" He stubbed out his cigarette, his eyes catching the ember before it went out.

&gt;""Yeah that's the money."" I nodded. He nodded.

&gt;""Put it there, I guess."" He gestured with an open hand to the briefcase. He shrugged. I nodded. He nodded.

&gt;""Hey, how about another cigarette?"" I shrugged. He nodded. I nodded. The cigarette nodded.

Obviously it's a silly example but I hope the thing that's clear from it is just how much all those tags drag on the dialogue. Find some stricter criteria for which dialogues can stand alone, and which **need** action tags, and you'll do a hell of a lot better in writing engaging dialogues. If you want a janky, jarring, staccato rhythm for creative reasons then by all means pursue this style of writing. It's just that I suspect people think this kind of writing is much smoother than it actually is. The smoothest dialogue scene, I believe, goes 'Dialogue / Dialogue / Dialogue' with minimal action or dialogue tags. 

Speaking of which, onto the next thought:

___

**Write your dialogue to stand alone**

A good test of dialogue (and characterisation) is that readers should be able to tell who is saying what in a scene even with no action tags or dialogue tags. 

This ideal is of course not at all practical, but I believe it is a good ideal to strive towards. Weak dialogue is not improved by strong tags, but strong dialogue can stand on its own. Keep in mind that studying TV and films to learn dialogue can fall short in some ways if you're writing novels. I think the impulse to cram too many action tags in there (including the 'shrug') comes from a cinematic ideal of trying to get the reader to see actors playing the scene out. 

Trust me, readers make the scene play out in their head just fine.

Take these three separate examples where the dialogue implies the action:

&gt;One: ""Get your hands off me!""

&gt;Two: ""It's over there, by the sink. No, the left one.""

&gt;Three: ""Oh! You scared me half to death.""

In each of those, I bet you can come up with a quite vivid character playing the scene out without any help. You already know what their gestures would be. Your brain is powerful. The reader's brain is powerful. Trust that.

Giving them too many action tags—this will be controversial—is on par with falling afoul of the 'show don't tell' principle. Inasmuch as 'show don't tell' is guarding us against explaining everything to the reader, *action tags explain the action to the reader, and it's often just as bland.* Even though the method of delivering action tags is technically 'show', the fact that you leave nothing at all to the imagination works in a similar way to make things less vivid. Reserve action tags for things that **contradict** the dialogue, or for actions the audience **needs to know**. 

&gt;Example: ""I love you."" A tear fell from her eye and she pulled the trigger. 

The words contrast the action, therefore it absolutely must be included. In the next example:

&gt;""Yes, I agree."" She nodded.

Get that action tag out of there. Burn it to the god-damn ground. It's not needed, and every subtle or unsubtle version of that is a bad idea. 

So how exactly do you go about making the dialogue do the work of the action tag? And is there anything else that can do the work of the action tag? 

___

**Dialogue and thought can express what gestures can, but better, and with more variety.**

Let's bring it back to the gesture at hand, the shrugging problem. These ideas can fit in pretty well with any other gesture (Rapid blinking, eyebrow lifting, lips curling, sneering, sighing etc)

So, as a creative writer, you are faced with a task: write someone shrugging, and do it vividly. You might go for a simplistic approach and say 'She shrugged.' That's fine, that works fine most of the time. In the context of this post, this kind of thing will wear thin faster. You might want to spice the gesture up, saying they shrugged in particular ways or with a particular emotional tone. That's all fine, too. But you're kind of locked in to the word 'shrug', aren't you?

Not really, I suppose. You could go for 'he lifted his shoulders' but that honestly makes me gag a little. The problem is, at some point you will run out of ways to vary the 'shrug'. Whether you modify it by saying *how* they shrugged, or express the gesture of shrugging with different wording, you'll just be working the same tired old tool until it wears out. 

Consider instead using thought or dialogue.

If you open up this toolbox, you'll find infinite variety instead of diminishing returns. 

Let's say, instead of making the character literally shrug, you want them to express what a shrug emotionally means. Generally I think this could be 'don't know, don't care'. There, you have one phrasing already, which might fit thought or dialogue. 

So you examine the character and their personality type. Are they more likely to speak, be silent and thoughtful, or gesture a lot? That can help you decide which avenue to go down. It is super important, I think, to consider this fairly often for all your characters, otherwise you will end up with scene after scene in which everyone shrugs, everyone sighs, and everyone pulls at their braids. 

So if they do speak, or if the POV character thinks instead of shrugging, how can you express their personality? Will they hit back with a very curt 'Don't know' or will they launch into a big defensive diatribe about not knowing the answers? What if an awkward silence falls, and instead of shrugging the POV character thinks for a while? (Don't overuse this, though. Overuse of this is way, way worse than overuse of shrugging). 

What if the character is a know it all, and doesn't like being caught on the spot and revealing that they don't know something? That is to say, what if they would never shrug and never say 'I don't know' because of their pride? Then you have even more options. Turn defensive, change the subject, straight up lie, etc. The list goes on and on when you use dialogue to do the work of the action tag, but the reverse is not true. There's *really* only one way to shrug. And as Rothfuss and his readers find, it gets old. Master of prose or not. 

Especially if you are using a limited third person POV that is aesthetically trying to mimic the experience of watching TV or film (most of us, I think? Or at least a big chunk of users here), you will be aware of how difficult it is to modify 'sighing' and 'shrugging' without breaking the show don't tell rule. My advice to you is to try and write the novel like a novel (crazy, I know) and stop trying to transcribe a scene in your head with actors in it. Trust the readers to mostly block their own scenes and direct their own actors in their imaginations. The more you block the scene for them and tinker with minor gestures, the less imaginative choices you actually give to the reader, and this can sometimes have the reverse effect of making the scene *less* vivid. 

____

**The end**

Again, I repeat the disclaimer, if you love action tags and they serve you well, that's fine. This post isn't intended for you and you can rest easy. The target audience are people who are fed up with making their characters repeat the same gestures over and over again, and want to know what else they can do to get out of that habit.",0

You don't need to literally kill your characters to drive the plot forward or to show that the stakes are real. You can brutalize them emotionally and physically and that will show the stakes are real just as much as literally killing them off can be.

I have worked out so much for this and I’m afraid if I lose feel for it I might not ever get back to it, or if I do it won’t be the same and I’ll forget important things.

Anyone ever had trouble letting go of something they spent so much time planning? How did you motivate yourself to move on?",0
t3_bxzn45,How do you bridge the gaps?,"I have  story in my mind at the moment which is fairly large (and seems to be able to  continue indefinitely if I want it to), but I'm struggling with finding ways to bridge between the highlight moments which I have laid out for my story.  I know I want to character X to end up in scene 5, for example, but I can't find the bridge to make it work. It seems like I can't come up with the mundane events to bridge events together to lead one part of the story to the next. The highlights come off just fine, but it's the bridging in between that I'm struggling with. Is this a common problem? How do you guys deal with it?",0
t3_bxxuf6,On Writing Endings...,"Specifically, the crafting of an ending.

I've heard that writers shouldn't plan anything at all, because if you do, then you're more likely to end up telling and not showing the entire thing. I, personally, have found this to be true: the more I plan, the more I tell. If I go in ""blindly"", I end up showing a lot more, and extending the piece.

Of course, editing could solve this issue but I'm content with how I write.

But I've also been told that you should plan multiple endings, so that you're prepared for whichever one comes more realistically by the end of the book, *especially* if you're writing a series.

I'm not sure what to do. Because I have the general understanding of what's going to happen at the end of my book, and I have a general understanding of how to get from point A to point Z within twenty-ish chapters. But I've been told (and am living proof) that planning doesn't help me. And I've also been told to plan, but have multiple endings.

Right now, I've planned out one ending, going against both of these pieces of advice.

So...what do you do? How do you dictate how you're going to craft an ending? Of course, it depends on the writer. But I'm just curious how other people write their endings, or decide how to plan, or not plan, their endings.

Just bounce some ideas around. What's your thought?",0

I feel like over a hundred years would break a person mentally, to the point where, upon release, they'd either be in a catatonic state or irreversibly feral.

My character obviously will suffer a lot from the trauma of their imprisonment, but I feel like whatever I write won't be enough for such an insane amount of time and trauma. So I've considered inserting (or at least implying) a supernatural ""loophole-"" that the power that allows her to be immortal also affects her mentally, so that whenever, while imprisoned, she started to go totally and irreversibly insane, it would ""reboot"" her mind, so to speak, and salvage her sanity. So that way, when she's freed, she still has trauma of the isolation, but I can still write her as a somewhat-rational human being and do the hundred-years time-skip, because that's kind of important to the story.

t3_by2ijt,How to Narrate YA Novel (TW),"TRIGGER WARNING. Dont read this if themes of abuse trigger you.

Hey r/writing!!

TL;DR: how do you know what perspective to write from?

Edit: I lied, it may not exactly be YA. I was mistaken. Apparently YAs can’t be this dark. Sorry 😐.

I'm writing a novel about a teenage boy who, after having killed his abusive father and his rapist -- and getting away with it -- moves to Toronto to live with his aunt and cousin from. Long story short, he meets the someone with whom he eventually falls in love, who also happens to be the drug lord's kid. The main character suffers from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder and also struggles with cognitive dissonance and all the other baggage that comes with being indoctrinated into an abusive religion then ceasing to believe it. 

I can't decide whether or not to also tell it from his best friend, who struggles with being gay in an oppressive religion, and being brown in a slightly racist society, but is also a manipulative bitch. And has a slight addiction to alcohol. I might just write one or two from his perspective, I dunno.

And finally, from the perspective of the protagonist's love interest. This person is really important, and is quite dynamic and will undergo more development than anyone else, and ultimately will die at the hands of a parent. I very likely will write from their perspective as well, but I haven't decided yet.

So, how do you decide how to narrate it? First, omniscient, third limited? And how do decide know whether to use past or present tense? It seems like ""I just want the pain to end. I want it to stop. Please, let it stop. I want to die. I want to die."" and ""Louis couldn't stand the pain. He just wanted a release. Even if that meant dying, he wanted it to stop"" basically mean the same thing, but I cant choose between them, or something different. For context, I'm an amateur writer, so if its really obvious or something and I'm just dumb, that's why.

Thanks in advance!

So, one conventional advice I've seen is to not have the character be in that situation in the first place. So in this case, the solution would be that I'd have my character win or survive every fight, but this would have the risk of falling into ""mary-sue"" territory or coming off as boring. On the other hand, there's no reason for the villain/antagonist not to kill the defeated character (from what Ive read, being spared or rescued comes across as plot armor).  

Another solution I've seen would be to simply kill and replace the main character, and I have actually. But I've run into the same problem with my second main character (The original main character's best friend, who goes from secondary to main when the original gets killed). I've thought about having the second main character simply killed again and replaced with a third protagonist, but I think I'll still run into the same problem of ""win every fight or die in the first loss"".

t3_bxv4jl,Feedback Tips - Part Three - What to Do with Feedback,"Hello! It’s time for a new installment in this blog series which I definitely didn’t forget I was writing.

We’ve talked about when you should ask for feedback and what kind of feedback you should ask for, but the next step is critical: What do you do when you get feedback?

Now, a lot of this will depend on what kind of feedback it is and what stage your book was in. If you just threw a first draft of a random chapter up in the critique thread here on /r/writing, that’s quite a bit different from getting a developmental summary back from a paid editor or getting the final copy back from your proofreader. But a lot of the same things apply generally, and I’ll distinguish where necessary.

##It’s Up to You

The first thing to know, before you even look at the feedback, is that you almost never have to do what the person says. This is obvious when it’s feedback from random people but can be more difficult to remember when you’re looking at critique from a professional editor hired by your publisher. In nearly every circumstance, you’re free to ignore the advice entirely if you’d like. That’s not the same as saying it’s a good idea, of course, but you don’t have to incorporate every change and you’re always able to at least suggest an alternative to the recommendations. (NB: if you’ve been picked up by a publisher, they may require certain changes as a condition of staying with them. However, those are almost certainly going to be critical to your book succeeding.)

##Read the Feedback

So, knowing that, the first step in dealing with feedback is actually reading it. That may seem obvious, but I’ve had clients actually skip this step. When I send an email with the edited document, I generally include an overview of a few points that are particularly important or where there’s some wiggle room. Sometimes, instead of actually looking at the attached, edited document, they jump straight into fixing those problems in the original manuscript. 

Even if you don’t go that far, you may be tempted to incorporate changes as you go. Perhaps you see a note that your MC’s eye color changes and the editor doesn’t know which you meant. So you decide that it should be blue and start changing every reference to the MC’s eyes to blue. Don’t do that. Read through all of the notes first, so you know what’s going on. It’s possible that, later on, it’s actually important that the MC’s eyes are either green or brown.

This especially applies to developmental editing. In nearly every case, 75% or more of the problems in a book are in the first half, even though they may only be evident in the final chapter. So if you start making changes before you’ve read through all of the notes, it’s possible that you will end up having to revert them later.

This doesn’t apply as much to copy editing or proofreading changes, where you may just be clicking accept changes or adjusting the spelling of a word, but you should still be careful when there is an actual decision involved. Make sure you know all of the relevant information before you make decisions and don't let yourself get bogged down in minutiae when you may  decide to make bigger changes down the line.

##Wait to Argue

Almost inevitably, there’s going to be something that you disagree with. Maybe it’s as simple as changing the spelling of a minor character’s name or as big as cutting out your final three chapters. And it’s tempting to immediately assume that whoever you got the feedback from is a moron and you should just ignore them. But you need to make sure that you’re actually right before you do that.

Not only do you need to be sure you’ve read through all the feedback before you argue with it, but you should also take at least a day to think about it. The longer the piece and the more abstract the feedback, the longer you should wait. In fact, for developmental editing, I generally recommend that the author read through my notes and then not do anything at all with the book until after our call to discuss, which we schedule for at least three days after they’ve finished reading through. I’ve had quite a few clients say that they had thought a suggestion was stupid when they read it the first time, but by the time we got on the phone, they’d realized that they had just been too attached to the original.

This also provides you with time to think about alternatives. No one you receive feedback from is infallible, after all. Even I’ve made mistakes in diagnosing problems. You may realize why it looks like there’s a problem with one scene when the issue is actually somewhere else or decide that you’d rather rewrite an entire section than changing the character’s weapon to a sword.

The most important thing here is that you don’t respond immediately. Give the feedback some time to simmer. 

##Make Changes

The final step is to actually make the necessary changes. That’s the point of getting feedback, after all. If someone just says, “your book is absolutely perfect, I wouldn’t change a thing,” it may make you feel good, but it’s almost entirely useless (and probably a lie to boot). So you’ll need to go through and incorporate their feedback into your work. 

As you’re going through, remember that you can make the changes as you see fit. If a comma splice is corrected to use a semicolon, you can make it two separate sentences instead. Or if there was a line at the end where you’d accidentally moved a scar to someone’s right side, you can decide that’s canon and change all the other references to the right, rather than just moving that one to the left. 

And, when you’re done, you’re ready for either another round of feedback or to move on to the next step in the publishing process!

________________________________________________

A note on beta readers: While it’s going to be tempting to read through the notes you get back right away, you ideally want to go through them all at once. I recommend waiting until it’s been two weeks since you got notes back or you have five sets, whichever is longer. You don’t want to make changes based on one reader’s feedback and then have the next reader point out that your changes should have gone the other way.",0
t3_bxxi6d,I can't decide the scope of my story," Overall, my story is about the main characters uncovering the empire-wide conspiracy of the reclusive pontiff of the holy state secretly priming the war between two superpowers, and using this opportunity to annex nearby kingdom and to eventually take control of the empire itself.

t3_bxq2wo,Plot and Lore should go hand in hand,"When I was in fourth grade, Twilight was all the rage. But because again, I was in fourth grade, I didn't understand it. I loved the lore and I loved Jacob, who was the only character who acted like a character. but in recent years, the only ""good thing"" I like about it now is the lore, since the characters, Bella especially, act like a-holes with no personality. heck, I hate Edward so much, its my theory that he's simply part of a Manson family type cult and he's an old man that wants to indoctrinate Bella.

So I put this out: be sure your lore and your plot go hand in hand.

1. Your lore shouldn't be vague. One great example for this is star vs the forces of evil, which has a series long allusion to racism. they can just be vague with the fact that the history was written by the winners or that there were casualties on both sides. but the spell book from the show portrays truly how extreme it was on both sides: Solaria wanted all monsters dead, and she even detailed methods on how to kill them, thinking they were happier that way. Meanwhile, even the monsters and the side that was suffering the most, have extremists: Seth of Septarsis wants all Mewmans dead, to the point where when the current Queen wants to make peace with a treaty, he says that he wants her dead. Even the monster king at the time when he was at his peak, who mind you eats people, says he's going too far. Honestly, it's really interesting, and while I do have a lingering question or two, I won't spend the entirety reading the book of spells and wondering what happened to him.
2. You shouldn't info dump, regardless of plot or lore. it should all come naturally, even if you have a fish out of water. If you want a good example, try game of thrones books. while many details of the targayeans and the world of Westeros are in other media, the books don't info dump. Bran doesn't say ""those are our kingsguard, and they're comprised of 7 members and were invented by the founder king."" no, he thinks ""I want to be a great knight like Arthur Dayne and join the Kingsguard and be a legend."" He does give exposition but doesn't info dump. We know from his words that Arthur Dayne was a badass, but he doesn't info dump on what his favorite color was or what size his BMs were. I obviously wouldn't say that in passing, unless its justified. Remember KISS.
3. Your plot should make sense, but the lore should act as a crutch. You shouldn't have to keep bringing up the lore of the story in the middle of the story. But you shouldn't ignore it either. Twilight suffered from this because the lore hardly existed at points, and at other points, vampires having powers is a plot device. For example, if vampires are ordered to move around every few decades, why do the Cullen children attend school, and why is the school alright with Jasper and Rosalie, who are apparently supposed to be twins, getting on with their foster siblings? Why do some vampires develop powers and not others? 
4. Keep your plot interesting: This is a way for people to ignore your lore at times. If they're focused on a super school action or dramatic scene, they're probably not gonna question something like ""does Endor have its own civilization?"" Yeah, that might be on their minds, but if the plot and the characters are interesting enough, they'll ignore it. I've started rewatching the Fairly Odd Parents, and one question I have wondered is why aren't fairies concerned about overpopulation? is that an extra reason why Jorgen more or less sterilized the fairy race and by extension the Anti-Fairy Race? But that didn't occur to me when I watched old episodes because they were funny and some episodes were kinda sad, especially the Crocker origin episode. 
5. Be sure the lore makes sense: I shouldn't have to stop reading to simply question the lore. it should be simple, but still complex in a sense. Twilight, I will admit, had good lore, but it suffered because they focused on the wrong thing. Why should I care about Bella when I can question where vampires came from, especially since the vampires in their world differ from ours? 

Hope this helps, and while I apologize for mostly including television, it still does have its own lore and its often a good way to improve, and sometimes quicker than reading. yeah, game of thrones is one of the best series ever written, but book 1 took me three months to read.",0

Right now, I'm only starting (again) with a Japanese novel with some conspiracy in the mix. I started it with just a short chapter to give some historical context. I think it's half a page and I'm not sure if it's good enough. 

I basically wrote enough to not make it to a history lesson.

t3_bxon3u,Do supporting characters need to be more than that?,"So in the novel I'm writing the story revolves around solely the MC who does come to have some secondary characters by his side. One of these characters I plan to make into having a somewhat larger role while the other one will be there to motivate the other characters to a course of action. (Basically, they go to save that character) but that's really the character's role. They do some things but not much as they aren't the MC and they aren't a prominent side character.  


Should I change that, however? Should I take the time to make that character have a more active role in the story even if they aren't the MC and they won't really be in the second book except as a driving force for the other characters?",0

t3_bxt88k,Realism making my writing boring?,"Hi,

I've been writing a spy-comedy (set in a nuclear power plant) for awhile. I've had decent feedback from beta readers but they all had the same issue with one of my chapters. It involves a couple of characters gaining access to encrypted files. This seems to be boring everyone which is as antithetical to comedy as you can get.

I've tried my best to keep the encryption realistic as I really hate books and movies which turn hacking into some sort of embarrassing, weird, magic, computer collage.

The problem has gotten worse. After watching the Chernobyl series I realise that I have misunderstood the cooling systems in nuclear power plants. After reading a bit more into how they work, I am making changes to keep the books finale realistic. This adds even more detail and I'm worried the beta readers response is going to be similar.

Is there an easy way to add complicated information without boring readers? There's only so many times my character can joke about the subject matter being boring.
Also is there any easy ways to see how modern British power plants work? I feel like I'm already on a watch list thanks to my google searches.",0
t3_bxqejm,How to give your characters interesting professions.,"So I've been struggling with assigning my characters' professions without it feeling arbitrary. Many stories are tied to the profession of the main character and provide a significant portion of the setting and character development, so choosing a profession to fit the character and the story is important.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my little method for finding interesting jobs that fit the character.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why is this person in this job?

Because Who Cares: These people are generally in entry-level positions or positions that generally have no bearing on the individual. Take cashiering, for instance. A character who is obligated to be in the job they're in are stuck and would rather be anywhere else, or they are just trying to get by. Or, if they are getting great pay, they are in a position where they no longer care about their dislike of the job because of the pay. Some stereotypical jobs might be a fast food worker, cashier, accountant, managers. Example: Squidward, from Spongebob Squarepants

&amp;#x200B;

For The Love: Whether or not this job pays highly, these people are in this profession for the love of doing it. A person in this job would be inherently motivated to do the job for the job's sake, even to the detriment of themselves. A typical for-the-love job might be a nurse, writer, or a schoolteacher. Example: Leslie Knope, from Parks and Recreation

&amp;#x200B;

For The Money: Someone with money or power as a motive for having a job might be crooked or simply hardened to emotions or people. They are heavily motivated to perform the tasks of their job in a way that benefits themselves. They may have had good intentions on their way to this position, but they have fallen by the wayside. Some stereotypes may be a CEO, politician, or a high school principal. People in power. Example: Francis Underwood, House of Cards.

&amp;#x200B;

For the Stars: Generally showing off, or having a big head. They are looking for either attention, satisfaction, or validation. They are using the job to fill something inside of themselves. People in this category are on one side of the line of arrogance. Either they aren't arrogant, but instead broken and seeking healing in the form of an attention seeking job, or they are already arrogant and are using their arrogance to hide their brokenness. A stereotypical job might be a performer or artist. Example: Sherlock Holmes.

&amp;#x200B;

^(these categories are not very well refined, and please feel free to suggest changes or additions!)

# Section 2: Swapping Stereotypes

So now that you've found a motivation that fits your character well, you need to find a job. Instead of going for the typical jobs you might think of for the motivation you've chosen, maybe try to mix and match! You'll get lots of interesting characters that have more depth.

&amp;#x200B;

Take SpongeBob, for example. He is a happy, go-lucky, nothing-can-be-wrong kind of guy. Looking at the categories above, I immediately say he's doing his job for the love of it. That's just who he is, and I couldn't see him being apathetic or corrupt in any job he does. But look at his job. Very solidly a job that would generally be done ""Because who cares?"" This is why SpongeBob at his job is funny in its own right. He is the happiest, most exuberant fry cook ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe a nurse who doesn't care.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe a corrupt schoolteacher.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe a retail worker doing it for the attention.

&amp;#x200B;

In all of these scenarios, you now have a world to craft around it! How on earth would a Target employee be getting attention? Maybe they are 15 but their dad knows the owner, so they got a job, and they are bragging to their friends. Or they are in their thirties and have had an incredibly hard time finding any work, and now that they have a job at target, they are so incredibly proud of themselves for it, to the point it goes to their head.

These swaps can be comedic, dramatic, or anything in between. A corrupt schoolteacher could be a funny kid's villain or a drama about a murderous English professor.

These categories are just ones that I could come up with, I'm sure you can find more, and try and match them in unexpected ways.

&amp;#x200B;

t3_bxu2ut,"Issues with naming consistency, quality and cultural similarity","

Over the course of developing my different settings for my stories, I've found that there's a growing problem with the names that my characters have. Often, I overthink the naming process to a ludicrous extent - while I don't aim to name characters ""meaningfully"", my fixation centres on the ""uniqueness"" of character names, which can be its own detriment. 

While the unique names are rather required in the more exotic settings I have, my biggest problem is that I can't *tell apart* how good names are half the time, which causes me a lot of grief, as I end up often being forcibly attached to those names due to calling the character by that for an extended period of time. Placeholder names often don't work out for me unless it's something conspicuous like ""newguy"", so I often end up being forever stuck with a name I'm not sure could be better or not. Often, I get paranoid about the quality of a name and continue to second-guess myself as whether it's a good name or not, wasting time on a problem that probably isn't all there to begin with.
******

Even with my writing friend, I find the renaming process (and naming for that matter) to be one of the least enjoyable activities, feeling like the writing equivalent of bashing my head against a brick wall. He doesn't enjoy it either, so I want to spare him the trouble of making him suffer and learn how to perceive whether names are good enough or not by myself. While I do have several years of writing experience and some general perception of how good names are, I often struggle to judge the quality of names because part of me ""settles"" on a name in order to escape the suffering of the naming process, of putting a name in, deciding it isn't good enough, then repeating ad infinitum.  Renaming characters is distinctly, another pain because I keep extensive lists of stories and OneNote documents holding my world's data, meaning that every time I rename them I have to go through and replace every instance of a name with their new one, unless I backpedal.


Brandon Sanderson has been a bit of an inspiration to me with his character names (Shallan, Kaladin, Asinthew, Waxillium, so forth) so I often find myself taking a leaf from his book and trying to make distinct, memorable unique names because they're more likely to become iconic in their own right (like how many games popularise names associated with them). As such, I tend to prefer Sanderson-esque names, but it varies depending on my settings - two in particular don't have naming issues because they're centred in real life and I can freely borrow real-world names without issue.  Most of my naming woes centre on my two primary settings - respectively, a sci-fi story with seven different species (which each have their own subcultures) and a multiverse story where characters from any genre can appear together.
Here, the issue is that I often prioritise sounding different, which causes some distinct issues. Particularly with the first setting, the amount of species and the potential subcultures make it difficult for me to determine consistency within naming, as languages are not my forte or particular interest of choice, meaning that I don't have a language or sound system to build that culture's from, instead just relying on twisting human names in clever ways, or putting together sounds that sound decent together. 

****
With names like Oriatta or Rozine however, I often grow paranoid because they end up distinctly being based off of human words despite being spelled differently and not aligning with a real human name (as they're meant to be familiar, yet ultimately different species). Part of me believes the names are fine, and I have been using those two for months now, while an annoying other part continues to complain that ""alien cultures should not have any resemblance whatsoever"", despite me already accepting that the familiarity is an inherent part of it. 

Others, like Deavie and Zan, are names that *do* exist in human demographics but are uncommon enough for me to give them to non-human characters, which raises their own implications, since these characters were explicitly not given a ""human"" name in-lore, but are names that are still distinctly human regardless.

Finally, some names like Elistair and Levett are twisted versions of human names, which I think are usually alright, but have the same problem as the other two with them being inherently derived from human culture rather than whatever culture the characters originated from. I think that ultimately, there's very little ""truly unique names"", which I suppose is a given as all fiction is filtered through the lens of humanity, but the concern here lies in how, I'm concerned about literary whiplash with how the cultural stew in the setting has resulted in this whole list of ""different, yet not so different"" names that you can't really tell ""belongs to a specific species or culture"", especially since it would be almost impossible for me to account for and determine the naming conventions of every species, subculture, world, district and dialect. 
****

While I'm already (mostly) satisfied with these six names I've posed as examples barring my own paranoia surrounding names, I don't know how to distinguish whether a name works or can be considered good or not, or mitigate my own paranoia surrounding it. This, combined with the problems I've outlined with the types of names I do have and how they end up congealing together into a terrifying jumble of cultural sounds and words, has led to me writing up these problems. Is there any way I can go about figuring out how to understand the quality of character names better, or making me like the names I create more so I don't overthink it as much?",0
t3_bxp1od,is it alright to force something just to get it down?,"I have a tendancy to have very defined ideas of certain senarios, but not much thought when it comes to gettting to them. as a result, i'll usually end up phoning in the in-between bits then rounding them out later in the second or third draft; i do this just so i can have a clear line of progression in my stories, but more often then not the scenes i come back too still sound phoned in even in the third or final draft. 

My question to you fine people is whether i ought to continue like this, or only right when i feel inspired for the situation at hand. i've considered doing what JK Rowling is famous for, namely writing the whole thing out of order as inspiration for each scene strikes you then making it coherent in the drafting process, but i have a genuine fear of never getting to scenes i ""dont like,"" so i'm loath to do so.

thoughts, suggestions and criticisms are welcome, as even though i've been writing creatively for years i'm never completely confident in my work as a rule.

t3_bxish8,"Writing a villain that readers will eat their hearts out over, but not justifying their actions","TLDR: My narrative is technically told by the villain, but this isn’t revealed until almost the end of the story. How do I make him likeable without justifying his villainy?

Or, if you’re willing to read some context:

EDIT: would probably help to mention that it’s a fictional narrative podcast rather than a piece of prose. Didn’t want to add that at first in case it wasn’t acceptable to put on a writing subreddit, sorry!

Naturally, until that point of the reveal, I do everything to endear him to the audience as if he’s the protagonist. He’s a dorky, loveable family-guy who seems to have a solid moral compass, and he frequently criticises the actions of the villain (his own actions).

He talks about some traumatic events in his past, such as having to turn off his dad’s life support as a young man, and seeing a ghost as a little kid who, as she grows older, he realises looks horrifyingly like his daughter.

At the start of the story he chooses to get involved in the assassination of an innocent woman because it’ll help his family. After this he feels so awful his mental health starts to deteriorate.

Other characters take advantage of this to force him into making worse and worse decisions, leading to severe paranoia and delusion.

At the end of the first part of the story, in a severe fit of delusion, he ends up killing his daughter. He’s distraught and frantic and this event completely unhinges him.

In the second part, set several years later, he hasn’t gone to prison for his actions due to his mental health, but has instead been placed in a high quality mental health facility. He has dissociative  amnesia, so scarcely remembers who he was or what he did.

In the story there’s a day on which the dead in the town can be raised, and he gets to see his dead daughter. She’s zombie-like and unable to communicate or even recognise him, but the trauma allows her father’s memory to be triggered and he gives an emotional apology.

At the end of the story, in a moment of lucidity, he begs another character to kill him, but of course she refuses and leaves.

If you’ve made it this far: thank you so much for sticking with me! I have a few questions, if you don’t mind:

1. Is having himself and others criticise his actions enough to show that they’re bad?

2. Do you feel suitably bad for him (I know you can’t be emotionally invested over this, but can you imagine, with proper context, that you would be)?

3. Have I done enough to show that he doesn’t do bad things because of his mental health, but rather his mental health is deteriorating because of his malpractice?

Thank you.",0
t3_bxkxuz,How can I foreshadow cosmic horror before the reveal?,"So I have this idea to a story that is suppose to subvert the trope of “the chosen one” when these teenagers are pulled into this portal hidden in a cave that take them to a fantasy like world. In it they come across a village of elves that believe they are the chosen one to slay the “demon king.” After fighting his henchmen, they fight the demon king, it’s realize to actually be a Lovecraftian monster that eat a couple of them and the other only escape through pure luck. It was then when they realize that the elves were actually using them for sacrifice and the “henchmen” were actually drugged wildlife’s and human (the elves are capable of hacking their mind to see what they want them to see basically). So I read that you don’t want to just throw the cosmic horror out of nowhere so what are some ways that I can make the themes consistent with it and foreshadowing it without making it obvious? Any feedback will help a lot.",0

Personally, I use WikidPad, which isn't technically for writing stories and the like, it is a wiki creator.

t3_bxozlk,How can I make my writing more authentic?,"When it comes to my work, most of the criticism I receive stems from the fact that my writing does not feel authentic enough. Not as in the characters don’t feel like real people or I lack inspiration, but the presentation in and of itself reads almost more like a summary of events than an actual narrative. I’m struggling to overcome this hump because I feel as though I spend a lot of time planning out my thoughts, figuring out how to express actions through words, and editing myself.

t3_bxmr4d,How to make choices?,"Sometimes when writing I am faced with a choice - I have to put A or B in the text, but not both; e.g. I have to choose whether my character Steve is a postman or a carpenter. Sometimes, one of the alternatives is clearly better, or it barely matters. But sometimes the choice has larger implications - maybe later on in the story Steve has delusions of grandeur, so if he's a postman he compares himself to Mercury and if he's a carpenter he compares himself to Jesus. 

How do I choose? I want my writing to be good, so I try to make these choices intelligently. But often I don't know either way so the dilemma paralyses me and is a cause of block.

I think [Fredkin's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredkin%27s_paradox) is a good heuristic to use here - if the choice is difficult then that means that the alternatives must seem really similar, and so the marginal benefit of choosing the right one is small. That sort of thinking is sometimes helpful, but it makes me feel like I'm not in control - that I'm just picking at random and not making real decisions.

t3_bxk44v,I'm feeling useless at giving critique lately. Any tips?,"I've been part of various critique groups for almost 4 years now. My main one is a group where people bring pretty much anything, ~2000 words snippets, read them at the group, make some written comments, and then a few minutes of verbal feedback. Lately I have barely anything to say about anyone else's work, for various reasons. I think this format makes me unable to properly analyze the writings since it's so fast-paced, but other people can manage it okay and I don't have the same problems with every single story. I mostly only catch grammatical and factual errors.

I've already read up on how to approach critique in general- get a general impression, see what worked for you, what didn't, what confused you. The problem is much of the time, I either have no opinion, or can't even follow the story so have nothing to say period.

This is particularly bad with three cases: First, short stories, because it takes me about 5,000-10,000 words to get grounded in a story most of the time, so if a story is 1,000-2,000 words, it's over before I can even figure out what's happening. Second, one person brings a story that's so description heavy that I can never tell what's going on. I have a vague idea of an overall plot but can only really take away a single sentence about what happened every time. Third, someone else brings in a fantasy story that seems to have no plot - it's just a bunch of people wandering and talking about basically nothing, so I feel there's nothing to comment on. I stay silent for these two people, since everyone else has comments and I don't want to be negative if it's just me having problems with their stories.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to approach this better? I fear my group thinks I don't care about their stories. I've considered trying r/destructivereaders, but fear being labeled a leech no matter what I do given these experiences.",0

t3_bxepr5,How to write a bestseller?,"In the thread [Try Something Intimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/bx9dto/try_something_intimate/) I noticed this comment, made by Milestyle. (emphasis mine)

&gt;I feel like this too. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone goes too big when they didn't need to. The only example I can think of is Prison Break, but it was a good show when they were just breaking out of jail. But then it went too big and it was all about the President of the United States and the corporation shadow government, just like wtf? Why?  
&gt;  
&gt;On the other hand, I know an author that asked his publisher why none of his novels are bestsellers, and his publisher told him, **""If you want a bestseller, you need to write a bestseller. Bestsellers have big actions, big consequences, and a romantic sideplot.""**

Is this what makes a bestseller? *""big actions, big consequences, and a romantic sideplot""* ... is that it? I feel that it has a bit of truth. It also sounds a bit like the blockbuster movie formula.

I think luck has a lot to do with it. The light novel series *The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor* is almost exactly the same story as *Ready Player One*. I think it's better, personally. Yet, it's the latter which is a bestseller. I think there is a viral element, a recursive accumulation. Stuff gets popular because it's popular. Likewise, it is important to have an opinion on Game of Throne, not because that piece of fiction is all that deep, but because its popularity in itself lends it importance. Skimming a bestseller list, I noticed that almost all of them was part of a book series. Of course, we don't hear of all the book series which never takes off.

I think writing a bestseller is a reasonable goal. I mean, you most likely won't, but it's worth striving to create something that would be read by a lot of people. Something bestsellerish.",0

Horror in essence brings to light everything we try to repress, so I thought it'd be genuine if it was personal to me as a lesbian. I haven't written anything yet, but an idea came to me looking at that creepy photo that circulated the internet this week of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

Now I love slashers, but alotta them are problematic and I think we should talk about it. The killers are often an 'Other' of society bcuz we fear the unknown. They're usually poor --- Leatherface and his family --- ugly or deformed --- Jason Vorhees --- and have homoerotic undertones bcuz gay = evil --- Freddy Kreuger. But what if I went the exact opposite direction?

t3_bxhm03,Split Story vs. Single Story,"I have a fantasy world with 3 major characters, all POVs of course. The story I've planned for almost a decade now seems to be coming to fruition, but I have a dilemma.

If you think about this story having two chronological halves, the latter half is much easier to write (and indeed, its certainly outlined well enough) because all 3 of the characters have had some measure of growth (positive and negative), and they've importance in the world to the point that their fates finally intermingle to the point where they are constantly involved with each other and working together towards the end of the whole story. *That* part is easy, because its the first part I planned when I started this 10 years ago.

However, its the beginning that sucks to think about. I basically have two options:

* **Single Story:** Contrive a reason for them to meet at the beginning of the story before sending them back off to their own corners of the world to have their growth and development and perspective before bringing them back into conflict, and later working together for the second half. The downside to this is that I feel like I'm losing a lot of story because I don't want a massive tome of seemingly disparate plots going on, not to mention that their ""meeting"" at the beginning is pretty contrived -- there's really no reason for them to meet in a way that is beneficial to their starting stories.
* **Split Story:** Each character gets more depth because I only write stories with their section of the world before bringing everybody back together for the second half, like the Marvel movies with individual plots before they reconvene to mess up some bigger bad. Downside? I just feel like its a risk. Everyone's plot is connected much more in the late game, and I just don't want to lose the readers' interest early on.

&amp;#x200B;

***Tl;dr:*** I'm having a reverse-A Feast for Crows / Dance With Dragons situation where I am starting with a lot of frayed plots that ultimately end up tying together really nicely, but I'm worried about readers losing interest early and don't have the experience to manage it.

Nerd culture and VR became so normalized in the future that people began to make real life reflect their favorite games/pop-culture “stuff.” It gets so extreme that factions form and develop their own territory to - in real life - look and feel exactly like their favorite “lands.”

For instance, their would be a town devoted to Star Wars, or a Middle Earth, GoT, etc. with rivalries between factions and it’s basically one giant nerdy competition/power struggle.

On some parts of the story I'll be writing something like a page, a page and a half on only dialogue. Sometimes it works, sometimes it comes off too dry; as if the reader needs to imagine a big part of the interaction, and thus most of the quirks of the characters and the conversation (and the story, in a deeper sense) get lost in this huge chunk of just-dialogue.

I think I need to read a couple of screenplays, see how stares and looks get written for film. A lot of times when I'm writing dialogue between two characters I picture it all like a Richard Linklater film.

Now i've loved all of these novels so much so that i remember reading for 12 - 16 hours occasionally when i got super immersed.

Currently  I'm reading Mistborn: The Final Empire and it already feels different. I  think it's the more added details for everything. I haven't really  gotten far enough in where I'm so immersed that it feels like I'm  watching a movie though.

I've a lot more  questions but I'll leave it for now lol What books would you recommend?   Main genre i like is fantasy but don't mind branching out if the novel  is good.",0
t3_bx99vj,Should i call this a chapter 1 or a prologue?,"So, i was editing the start of my fantasy story (i'm around chapter 26 now) and i came across this question:

 The first chapter starts heavily centered around a secondary character, but by the end of it he saves the mc's life and all the following chapters are focused only in the mc POV.

 Here is the problem, should i call it a prologue or keep the ""chapter one"" title?

Edit: As some peoples asked me there to put more details: The events of this chapter doesn't have any timeskip from the others. I actually considered deleting it, but this way i would make the start a bit more confuse for the reader, since the mc being rescued is essential to be able to do some major plot twists, so the only thing which i could change is the perspective.",0

t3_bwzb4i,I can't believe I was ever so naive to think I could get by as a pantser,"No offense to the successful pantsers out there, btw. 

Over the years I would begrudgingly make more and more notes before beginning a novel, but now I've written my first full-fledged outline—plotting the vast majority of the plot points and twists, and some of the smaller details I would sometimes forget when pantsing. The relief I feel going into this new project (a rewrite of a story that's never worked, with a cast of characters I felt just needed the right plot) is incredible. Obviously there's still the chance things could change as I actually write it out, and that's fine, but it seems like such a relief to have it already fairly well planned. As someone who dislikes editing immensely, I'm kicking myself for being so stubborn and not doing this sooner.

t3_bx6fww,How do I write two main characters on different timelines without confusing the reader?,"Hey everyone,

I'm in the process of planning out my first novel (super excited!). I have a very strong idea of what I want the story to be, but I'm lost on how to structure it. Here's the gist (sorry if you think it sounds like a stupid plot):

There are two main characters - one man and one woman. The story follows their life as they go from innocence to struggle to freedom/purpose.

Man: The man's story follows his life from ~12 years old to ~28 years old. After being exposed to pornography at a young age, the man struggles through a life of sex addiction and objectification of women. His story reaches a (first) climax when he breaks free from addiction and finds love.

Woman: The woman's story follows her life from ~6-8 years old to ~35 years old. Coming from a broken household, the woman struggles to find love in a society plagued by objectification of women. In college, she's pressured by her boyfriend into taking lewd photos leading to a dark path down pornography and prostitution. Her story climaxes when she breaks away from her pimp only to die after being hit by a car as she runs away.

Things get funky in that the characters meet at the very end. The man sees the woman get hit by a car. He holds her in his arms as she dies. It is during this moment that the man realizes she was one of the women he viewed in pornography as a boy.

During each major stage of their life, the characters face parallels struggles. The issue is that they happen on two different timelines. The timelines then need to merge at the end for them to meet.

I've had 3 main ideas on how to struggle it:

1. Tell the entire man's story first, then the woman's. End together.

2. Tell the entire woman's story first, then the man's. End together (I don't think this works right because the woman doesn't have a ""first climax"")

3. Switch back and forth between the two characters. Have woman get hit from her perspective, end with the man's perspective holding her (I fear switching may be too confusing if they're on different timelines)

I lean towards option 1, but I would love to hear some opinions from experienced writers.

Let me know if you need more information about the story.",0

t3_bx3okr,When a short-story becomes a novella... and then a novel.,"Just a post asking for some commiseration about a short-story that I wrote that ended up teasing me with the usual ""there's more story to tell here... so, you better get writing.""

It started out as a short-story. Just a pervy little exercise to just have some fun with a scene.

Then there was more to it. Little bits came at me during the tired days, and the sleepless nights, and all of them were the same thing; little snippets of scenes that felt like they had a place in this story that apparently wanted to be told.

I am grateful for the inspiration, but... AAAAUGH! 

And this isn't the first time this has happened either. There's another short-story that was telling me there was a TON more backstory involved and it's waiting its turn (thankfully.) 

So, who else has that kind of thing happen? Is this fairly common that a story will just grow on you, and grow under your care? Or are you more the ""This is the story, this is what I'm telling, and that's it"" kind of writer?",0

I have what I think is a somewhat original idea, I have about sixty or so pages, four pages of a planned outline and several more scenes I want to write, but I'm getting struck with what I'm calling writer's despair.

t3_bxavuu,How can I justify this character dynamic?,"My protagonist has headmates (similar to DID, but without inter-identity amnesia or uncontrollable personality switching). The antagonist has experience with what personality switches look like. I’m going for a Dexter Morgan/James Doakes kind of dynamic, except instead of the protagonist fearing death if the antagonist learns he’s a serial killer, the protagonist fears the loss of her reputation if the antagonist learns she has headmates.

Here’s what I came up with to justify the dynamic:

* 1) protagonist has headmates, and is married to the antagonist. They have a son.
* 2) They break up (my attempt to explain why the story doesn’t have a Mr. Protagonist) on good terms when the antagonist accepts his homosexuality. He marries a man who turns out to have DID.
* 3) Antagonist can’t take the chaos caused by the DID, breaks up with the man.
* 4) Protagonist doesn’t like the stress of keeping her headmates a secret, so she explains the concept of headmates to Antagonist to test the waters. She’s trembling with excitement, which makes him suspicious. He isn’t conscious of it, but he’s pissed at the idea of people mocking DID; if he found out about Protagonist’s headmates, he’d expose her secret out of spite, and stigma and stereotypes would destroy her reputation.
* 5) He starts stalking protagonist to try and figure her out.
* 6) Protagonist moves to a new city, antagonist secretly moves there too.

Are there any better alternative justifications?",0

I have permission to write and publish the story, but no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to do justice to this very touching story. Besides that, I've also had to put it on hold for quite a while because there was a genuine safety threat to the lives of the characters. (The dictator has since been removed in a Coup d'état - so the threat no longer exists)

I don't exactly know what genre it would fit into, but I would call it a Historical Drama with a prominent Romantic undertone.

Although it's based on a true story, I've endeavored to fictionalize it just enough to make it comply with commercial publication standards.

I have created a full outline and scene list (which can be changed where necessary) and have also written about half of the story. I'm just not satisfied with what I've written so far.

I would really like to find a co-author to write this with me. I don't want to give too much away, because I want some fresh ideas on the story, but if I were to write blurb on the back of the published book, it would go something like this:

&gt;""**Based on a true story and set in Zimbabwe in 2002, this drama tells about a courageous woman who dares to take on a dictator. The country is at the height of its turmoil when she realizes that protecting a family inheritance will reveal a terrifying secret that may jeopardize her marriage. This story explores the human infallibility in the question that asks, 'When is it okay to break a promise?'**""

I will be happy to reveal my outlines, notes, draft, and scene lists to someone who is ready to commit to this with me.

t3_bx8cgh,The problem I have with three-act structure and the way stories are told today.,"We all know it. The first quarter of the story sets up the events, the second and third quarter of the story set up the middle and provide complications, and the fourth quarter is the resolution. Also, in between these acts (you can call them the inciting incident, pinch points, the midpoint, and climax), there are certain events that 3-act structure say must happen. There is also the age-old beginning, middle, and end that Aristotle says every story must have. There’s the thesis (providing the dramatic question), the anti-thesis (the argument against the thesis), and the synthesis (the answer to the dramatic question or argument — the theme). Three act structure is also supposed to represent change or transformation in character. Save The Cat utilizes three-act structure and is probably the best definition of it in terms of putting it into words (bad guys close in, all is lost, and dark night of the soul — for example). The problem I have with it is that I’ve been trying to write this one story for nearly eight years now, which is also as long as I’ve been a writer. For these years, I’ve been trying endlessly to fit it into a structure. For a long time, and probably still, I’ve tried to use episodes and seasons (like for a television series) to split up my story into pieces, but that also doesn’t work because each episode also mandates that you follow the three-act structure (or four act-structure or five-structure, which are really just three-act structure with the middle divided up). Also, lastly, the three-act structure suggests at every turn there is conflict that must happen and a “villain” to be defeated, whether that’s self, nature, or man. But what if your story (the story you imagine in your head) can’t fit into three-act structure, what if there is no theme, what if it can’t be divided into episodes, what if it doesn’t have a beginning, middle, and end, what if there is no catalyst. Obviously I’m getting ahead of myself and that even if I did try to write a story without these elements, I would probably have included them without me knowing or on a subconscious level. Here is the problem and solution I think there is to the whole thing: the problem is with the medium in which the stories are told.

&amp;#x200B;

Films are divided into 2-2.5 hours and television is divided into .75-1 hour per episode. Also, these mediums suggest that something significant should happen at the 25% (crossing the threshold), 50% (the reversal), 75% (all is lost), and 100% (resolution) marks because stories must have a beginning, middle, and end when following three-act structure. Why when all movies and stories nowadays follow three-act structure, some are panned and others are lauded? If they’re following this paradigm that theorists suggest cannot fail, then why do most do? It seems the problem is that stories are being forced into an arbitrary length of time (compared only to the story) because some stories can only work when they’re longer or when they’re shorter, when they’re told in four hours opposed to two hours. Would the entirety of Lord of the Rings work if it was condensed into two hours for a film or eight hours for a television where each episode of the eight-part series had to be cut off at a cliffhanger for at the end of every episode? No, and this applies probably to every other story out there that has failed. The problem is with the medium the stories are being told through, some arbitrary number that some executive out there decided was the attention span of most audiences. But the truth is we all have different attention spans, as evidenced by the fact that some or most of us can binge through a show for hours at a time that are much longer than two hours. But even if we tried creating a story that was longer than two hours, then it would have to be considered a television show, but then then the problem becomes that each episode has to be contained or end on some kind of event (like the inciting incident, plot point 1, or midpoint). The problem again is with the medium in which stories are told. Stories aren’t meant to all be divided into equal lengths of time. Some stories (or most stories) demand to be told in a longer or shorter space of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of these forced lengths of time stories must be told through, this is why I think three-act structure has been implemented into the minds of writers and audiences. Because stories are forced to be told in a certain length of time, it suggested that some kind of formula can be derived. But I think it’s time the world is moving beyond this and now here is the solution I think for this is: time shouldn’t dictate the story, story should dictate the time. We’re moving into a world of story where there is no more need for formula, no more need for these arbitrary numbers stories that have to fit into (like eight, ten, or thirteen episodes for a television show or two hours for a movie). Stories should take as long as they need to and no less or no more. There is no reason that each “act” has to be the same length. The only reason there are acts is because people needed breaks, but now we have goddamn pause buttons and so there is no need for these “acts” anymore. We all pay for services now to stream and so there aren’t even any needs to stop a show to watch commercials. The story of mine I’m creating is long, complex, and does not follow any kind of structure I’m aware of. I believe this is the problem I’ve been having with it for so long, as I’ve been trying to fit it into a medium that is popular and followed, but that it doesn’t fit into. One can say that novels are the only solution as they can be told in anyway one wants, but then the problem again comes that stories must be at 80,000 to 100,000 words or else no one will want to read your book or publish it because it could be too long or short. But the solution to this is that we don’t read paperback books anymore. We all can read online, so what’s the point of trying to fit into this medium? Because our stories are being forced into these arbitrary spaces of time, this is the only reason three-act structure is being suggested, because it provides a formula. But not all stories work this way. Some are continuously told and are so fashionably well written that at every turn there should be an “act break” or “midpoint.” Think of early Game of Thrones. It had exciting things happen at practically every scene and there was no inciting incident, midpoint, or climax, though you could say however that every scene instead followed this pattern, and maybe that’s what I’m trying to get at. I think what made Game of Thrones so successful is that it was a story told in its own way on its own time. There was nothing restricting it that would hinder its story.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know yet what I’m going to do with my own story and how I’m going to express or structure it, but I know I’m not going to try and fit it into these arbitrary numbers to try and tell it. I’m going to tell it in the length of time it needs to, without all these “plot points” every story theorist says I must have.",0
t3_bx5ii4,How can I create stand alone plots?,"Hi guys, I'm a wanna-be writer.  I've heard so much about character arcs, making interesting characters, etc.  I feel like I've developed really interesting characters, some of whom I literally think about all day.  

The problem I have, is that I can't create a story.  I'm talking about a truly interesting series of events that doesn't event need characters to shine.  Of course great characters really amplifies everything.

What are good processes for actually coming up with really interesting plots, the kind that you could summarize as a fairy tale and they'd still be interesting?

t3_bwx85u,My main villain's back story is kinda lame/stupid+ how do I write a good plot?,"My villain is an arch demon, or Nemesis as I call it in the series, and they're basically the highest tier demon possible making them the ""kings"" of the underworld, and the book is about them being released into the world and wreaking havoc. The MC's job is to basically do a clean up what his ancestors failed to do centuries ago. The thing is, my main villain's motive is kind of ass, and I mean the villain's main goal is that he just want to live on the earth! He really doesn't want to die, so his job was to avoid MC, but since destiny prevails that's kind of impossible and they clash a few times until their final confrontation. Is this plot line weak? I dunno how to expand on what I already have. I know  both mc and the villain's motive's are opposite. MC want's to kill villain so there can be peace on the earth and the earth's curses be lifted from the Nemesis, since they're technically not supposed to be there, but the Nemesis want's to live a somewhat peaceful full filling  life.  Also, these Nemesis can almost pass for human, however their main issue is that they have horns sticking out of their head that's almost impossible to hide even with long hair.

It's a story written in POV and my main character is an Elf that controls ice as his element (as for the prophecy calls for it. because the first nemesis is a Nemesis that wields fire)

TLDR: Weak villain/plot, and I  don't know how to make it better.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edits\* YO thank you guys so much for the advice thought it was kinda lame, and thank you for those comments! I'll work on MC's motives for sure his seem kind of lackluster, and to make things clear, when I mean ""pass for human"" for the Nemesis(demon lords) they're literally demons but look  like human's except minus a few differences, so with horns, wings, or tails. That kind of thing, oh and they use magic too, but underworld magic.

I have a few chapters that I'm ready to write and I know I want to be included (that would be terrible if I didn't have anything at all for the middle lol). I feel like writing them first is a bad idea just in case I need to change things and maintain the flow of the story.

 I started writing the draft for this story and found myself feeling like I didn't have enough to write for the chapters I don't know about and they ended up being boring with barely enough action, almost like they had no point. It's like I have vague ideas for some chapters of what I want to happen, but not enough to write a whole chapter that's meaningful to the story. I also get indecisive and am not sure wether or not what goes into the chapter is actually contributing to the story or not.

I guess I just wanted to ask as a general question: how do you come up with the middle of a story?

Until recently, I haven't written anything and now that I'm getting back into it I'm hitting some ""stage fright"". Starting a story is always the hardest part for me, but I do have an scene in particular I'd like the story to start off with.  I sit down to write, and I just get stuck and frustrated. I know that my writing skill has taken a nose dive, and that annoys me but the most frustrating part is that I just want to enjoy/ write stories for me rather than worrying what others would think if they read my work. I know that I can always go back and edit the story once I'm done, and that even if I didn't it can just be something for me to enjoy. I just have this persistent feeling every time I write that I have an ""audience"" judging every little thing I write and I just freeze up and want to stop.

""Standing where the dust meets the sand, he looked upon the ancient hamlet. The place he hopes to save. The place he wished to prove to himself, that a morsel of hope could outshine his demons.

But the blood on his axe and the billowing smoke stood a monument to his failure. A display of his hopeful futility.

Sonhack, he was called. He waged the greatest war ever known. A war that schorched everything he ever loved. It was over now, with it's conclusion he hoped to find some peace with the blood on his hands. Some respite from the crushing weight of the souls he must carry. But now, it was clear that peace could not be held within him.

His error was his hope. His hope that humanity could rise above the disease of conflict. The error was his belief that conflict was the disease. He sees now that it is a symptom. Of a far greater disease. The disease of humanity.

He looked upon the charred bodies. Small and black under the shadow of the burning church. And swore to himself. No more. He would end war. He would end humanities instinct to destroy. Even if he had to drag them kicking, screaming or dead. No more.""

Wanted to know if this works with the idea behind the villain. His motivation of wanting to prevent conflict being altruistic but being contorted by a delusion of grandeur.",0

Here is what I have read in fantasy: Terry Pratchett, Lord of the Rings, the Eragon series, most of Joe Abercrombie and then some other novels that weren't so remarkable. Edit: and all of Game of Thrones. 

So here are the recommendations I am looking for.

1. Today's central fantasy. So like books that are core ""standard"" fantasy. The main pillars behind the genre and specifically more modern ones. You could also say that I am looking for something that shows the current tropes (while still being fun to read!)

Then. 

2. Basically the opposite. More niche areas of fantasy that are different to the core stuff. Books that don't follow tropes. 

And finally. 

3. Examples of fantasy that has unique writing styles or does something totally different.

Also here's a bonus question. Although I may want to do it later, all my current ideas are not traditional fantasy but rather a sub genre I am calling ""historical fantasy"" so it features real places and points in history with some historical events and people but with a backbone of fantasy involved with it.

The problem is that I do have a bunch of characters with distinct personalities who can make their own decisions but I don't have a setting to put them in. I don't know if these characters would do well in some fantasy setting, or sci-fi setting, or maybe present-day world setting.

I have ideas on how the characters will interact with each other but don't have any reason for them to meet each other at that moment. This build-up would depend totally on the book's setting - in medieval times the build-up would be completely different from the build-up in a post-apocalyptic world.

The flashback shows him witnessing the forest god, but he had woken up afterwards, leaving eight-year-old him unsure if it was a dream or not. At the end of the tunnel chapter, the sea god (from his dreams) appears.

I initially thought about showing a conversation between Eiwyn and the god, but decided against it. I currently have the chapter ending with a flash of light, brief glimpses of the god, and him recognizing it from his dreams. His friend Kaiji (separate chapter/POV) finds him in the tunnel and they get out, and I currently have Eiwyn not remembering what happened—which I’m unsure about.

Part of my intention is, especially early on, to cast doubt on the fantasy/supernatural elements, such as whether or not the dreams are just the dreams of an imaginative kid or something more “real.” Eiwyn and Kaiji use their phone lights in the tunnels and the batteries die, and Eiwyn feels like he spent hours wandering underground, but once out their phones are only like 5% less than before and maybe 10 minutes have passed. An earthquake had caused the floor to collapse, which is how he got underground and they got separated, but later they realize there were no reported earthquakes and geologically the part of the country they’re visiting doesn’t get earthquakes. 

This whole experience (over three? chapters) is the first time seemingly “real” fantasy things happen, so I’m not sure how the character’s memory (or lack thereof) of seemingly fantasy things should be handled. A couple chapters later there are a couple more (real) experiences that convince Eiwyn of the fantasy things which sets him off on his fantasy adventure, but I’m not sure what to do with the tunnel memories. Kaiji finds him in the tunnel once the “whatever happened with the god” ends and Eiwyn is kinda dazed and at first isn’t sure what’s going on, and later says he just remembers wandering around forever.

Is it too convenient/lazy to have him not remember what happened? Should he remember, but Kaiji doesn’t believe him? Maybe Eiwyn had hit his head, which would “explain”the memory loss, or possibly make it seem like a hallucination. Should I go more Lovecraftian where his “human mind [is unable] to correlate all its contents .. [and] the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of [his] frightful position therein, that [he] shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age?” 

As I mentioned, I originally thought of the god basically infodumping Eiwyn’s secret heritage and importance (eg Jon Snow=Aegon Targaryen) only for him to conveniently forget, but I decided against that and left it unknown to the reader. If he forgets what happens, then it doesn’t really matter what the conversation/experience was about, but if I go the unreliable narrator route, then I probably need to know what happened for him to unconvincingly tell Kaiji . And since Kaiji also experienced some “unexplainable” things, would he more likely to accept Eiwyn’s more fantastical claims?

t3_bwo71z,Where do you draw the line between writing for someone else and writing for yourself.,"I've recently been offered to write reviews for TV-shows and stuff as a script for a youtuber who plans to make a video on it.
thet've asked me to do a demo script for any favorite show of mine.

I'm really excited for the opportunity but the thing is, I kinda wanted to make a script/video on shows that I love myself , like for my youtube channel and stuff. So am kinda conflicted as to how personal can I get with the review now.

Like I want to give my best for this script but I also know I cant write my best if I dont get personal with the material and I cant get much personal with the material  because I want to make something on it myself latere down the line.

So how do I fix this problem ? Or is there even a problem here at all ?

Should I just  go write my personal review or is there a way to write good while not being personally attached to it temporarily ?

Or some really nice idea I haven't even though about lol

t3_bwqm2x,Anyone here write for iWriter?,"So about a month ago I wasn't writing for money, and then I applied to a bunch of websites to write articles for money and got accepted. I had to submit writing samples so I assume they liked my writing. I actually got accepted to more places than I thought.

I picked up 3 assignments on iWriter in the last few days. They tell you how much you potentially earned before customers reject or accept the offers. I was at about $30. One person sent me saying he loved the article and wants more, but has not approved it yet. 

My issue is with the other two. They waited until the last minute, and they didn't reject anything outright, but the posts are deleted. This means it either expired, they took someone elses content, or they took mine without paying me. 

Now I have no way of knowing which is the truth, but I have a strong feeling people are using this site to scam writers and get free product. On the platform, they can reject assignments. Therefore, they can read the assignment that's been submitted. What's to stop them from copying and pasting my piece of writing, then deleting the post? 

It's really disheartening and has left me feeling like writing might not be for me. I was so extremely excited that A - People liked my content and B - I was going to get paid for my content. Then they yank two of the (possible) payments out from under me and a third is probably going to do the same.

/rant
I enjoy writing and have it in my heart, and evidently, I'm a decent writer to get accepted into several content sites that screen writers beforehand. But maybe my writing isn't good enough for the real world? Maybe this whole writing career thing is just a delusion?

In my life, whenever I get happy or excited or hopeful, something comes along to smack those dreams back down to the dust where they belong. Because of this, I try not to get excited about stuff, but with the writing I couldn't help it. Here I was, thinking I'm garbage, and yet people are accepting me as good enough to write articles for them. One company, then two, then four. I knew I should have kept my hopes and dreams in the fucking garbage can because that's where they belong. Evidently, I am NOT in fact, a good writer. /endrant

t3_bwum8h,[ADVICE] Hiding character Motivations for the protagonist,"Howdy All,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently trying to write a piece that focuses on a witch hunter hunting a witch, the twist being that the hunter doesn't want to murderkill the witch, and instead wants to become an apprentice / learn magic. I'd like this twist to happen in the middle and to carry on with the rest of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

My current issue is this: How do I hide my protagonists (the witch hunters) motivations while also keeping them an interesting character / well-defined character? I feel like if I was the reader, I'd simply be annoyed at being kept in the dark. One thought was revealing portions of their past that drive their actions, with a final ""flashback"" to wrap up / explain the twist. Another idea is to have the protagonist comes to the conclusion as an ""epiphany"" moment rather than implying it was entirely premeditated, something along the lines of realizing that their hunter friends aren't all that they're cracked up to be (however, I do feel like this dampens the ""twisty-ness"" of the situation) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently writing in 3rd person omniscient as it comes most naturally to me, but I'm open to other POV's if you feel like it might help the situation. Mostly I just wanted to get my thoughts on paper to see what I'm working with, so thanks for the help! Regardless, I appreciate any and all input.

t3_bwmz15,"Writers are told to read a lot, but how exactly should we be reading?","One of the most common general pieces of advice for someone to be a good writer is to be a prolific reader, read, and read a lot.

That's all well and good, but I rarely see anyone mention *how* you should read to improve your writing. I'm not saying there's a wrong way to read, after all reading should be for your own benefit and enjoyment above all, but there is more than one way to really take in something. If you are an editor, you actually pay attention to the parts that most readers don't focus on, the grammar, the punctuation, the craft of writing itself. If you're a student you are taught to pull out the relevant data, to find the key words and information you need to complete your project.

So what, as writers, should we be most paying attention to? I suppose it does matter a lot on *what* you are writing, but let's assume for the sake of discussion we're talking about writing a fiction novel which seems to be one of the more popular topics within this subreddit and in general.

Again, I know there's no wrong way to read, but I am asking other writers to share what they particularly look for when they read, things they pay more attention to that help them in their own writing. It's easy to get so swept up in the story you don't look at all the parts that make the story come to life. 

How do you think aspiring writers should read to better improve their writing?",0
t3_bwpy9y,How many sex scenes are allowed in a novel which *isn’t* erotica? Is there a limit?,"I hope this question isn’t breaking any rules. I’m hoping you lovely folks can help me!

No spoilers for Game of Thrones or Banshee tv shows, but using those as an example, they have a *tonne* of pretty graphic sex scenes. Either show could have ditched those all together and the stories would have been the same but the whole vibe of the show would change. 

My novel is like this, it’s not about sex in any way, I’m struggling myself to define it but it’s mostly science fiction. I could easily not have one sex scene and yet, *something* would be missing. 

It wouldn’t be obvious to anyone but myself but it wouldn’t feel like it made the same impact if that makes sense? 

For example the way I use sex scenes is not for the sake of having them but to show important things about my characters. For example one of the main characters discovering his sexuality and exploring that. I have no intent whilst writing for readers to be getting off on it, if they do it will be a side effect haha!

The more I write (nearly finished first draft), the more I wonder if the amount of sex scenes I have included would prevent me from being able to seriously publish and whether it would just be automatically considered erotica? I have nothing against erotica but if I daydream about one day having my book in a shop, it’s not in that section. :)

So I’m turning to you lot for advice! 

If there is a hard limit on how many scenes you can have before it’s considered erotica please let me know. I have tried searching myself but I haven’t had any luck. Perhaps it’s not the amount of scenes but how graphic you get? I don’t know know. 🤷‍♀️ 

Thanks to anyone who helps and sorry this was long, I’m tired and my brain isn’t able to be succinct today :)

t3_bwsb0a,Confused about the genre of my book,"My book was always intended to be sci-if fantasy. Here’s my longline (It’s a WIP but bear with me):

One day, seemingly ordinary people from all over the world lose their ability to comprehend and communicate with language. In return, they gain the ability to transform into any animal of their choosing and to communicate via body language and a vastly wider range of emotions. Ostracized by the human race, they must learn to form their own society. 

I have plans for this book. 
1) I want it to be a series.
2) I want aliens to be the reason they got their abilities (and have scientific explanations for it all)
3) I don’t want them to find out about the aliens until the second book. 

Number 3 is where I’m finding issues. If there are no mentions of aliens in the first book (beyond some funky dreams that serve as a message from the aliens and remain largely unexplained, but not jarringly so), or any real explanation of why they’re the way they are, is it still sci-fi? I want their discovery of the aliens to be its own plot in the second book, with them discovering their species name and trying to piece everything together, then trying to leave earth when they realize they have a place to go. The third book would be them trying to find their place in the alien world. 

I really don’t want to reveal they are aliens in the first book. The first one is about My hero, Stormy, as she struggles to cope with her social anxiety and learns to trust others amongst the stress and chaos of the humans trying to kill her and her new friends. The second will be mostly about her learning that the human race isn’t all bad, that the action of some shouldn’t be what she bases the opinion of the many off of (some of the other shapeshifters turn out to be less than savory, And some of the humans turn out to be not a single bad as the bad guys from book one had lead stormy to believe) Third would be about responsibility, she has to put away her fun and games mentality and buckle down. 

Sorry, that was a bit of a rant. Either way, there is already a lot going on in book one without a bombshell like that being dropped on the readers. Book one was originally going to be a lot more like book two at first, but I changed it drastically. I want the worst of Stormy’s problems to be the military sent to kill the “monsters” (the shape shifters) and learning hate she needs to trust her new family. Adding aliens to the mix is too much.",0
t3_bwrp0h,Mental conditions for my characters,"So my story is going to involve a lot of mental health. Insanity, psychopathy, anxiety, paranoia, fears, and irrational fears.

I would like some help on deciding on qualifiers of what kind of mental disorders would make for interesting characters that would still be relatively useful in a Lovecraftian psychological horror. People who are broken but can still...function.

t3_bwkdqd,Advice for getting started,"This turned out to be a pretty long post and helpful to me even just in writing it out, but any advice for those who are willing to read will be greatly appreciated:

For some years now (with a “hiatus” due to becoming a father and unfortunately dealing with depression) I’ve been building several different story ideas, ranging from short stories to novels, most of which I have figured out many of the main plot ideas, themes, several of the characters, endings etc, and filled notebooks with point-form notes about plot, point of view, even stylistic ideas and justifying how they tie in. Basically, I have several very fleshed out ideas for stories, but have only started up a few actual introductions, and written only a few scenes and dialogues. 

I’m looking for ideas on how to begin that transition from idea to product, or being able to start that first draft. 

Here are some of the points that are preventing me from moving forward:
 
1) My laptop died, so until I can replace it, I’m writing by hand. But this, I know, is an excuse. Computers and even typewriters are fairly new technology when it comes to writing. 

2) I know I’m going to suck at first, and I guess I’m having trouble choosing which of my ideas to sacrifice to that process. I know if the idea is strong enough I should be able to rework it eventually, but I find myself trying to chose which idea to focus on to start out with, rather than working on the story that excites me most at the moment (because I’d rather be more developed when I tackle the stories I’m more excited about). 

3) Making decisions. I often have two or three versions of how I want something to happen or when or to who, and I suppose I have a bit of a fear of committing to one idea (this problem stretches beyond writing in my life, haha). 

4) Desire to write versus time spent researching. I often have story ideas about something I’m interesting in learning more about, but in trying to manage my time when I feel energized to tackle the story, I feel unprepared because I feel I should spend the time doing more research. 

5) I tend to overthink things, which I am now feeling this post is a good example of. 

Any tips, anecdotes, resources, or motivational quips will be seriously considered, as I’m ready to get to work making these stories find a place in the world.

t3_bwjt43,My character's kind of an asshole,"Sorry for the long post. It's pretty detail-oriented. 

A basic briefing of my plot thus far: a nephilim prince comes to Earth from some other world. Through a series of wacky events, he ends up kissing my main character, binding her to him as his princess forever and ever. She's basically some random teenage girl, not at all equipped to be a princess, and one of my subplots focuses on her learning and growing to become an acceptable leader.

The problem is: my hero is coming off as a little bit of an asshole. He cares about her, but he has to push her *hard* to get her ready for prime time before they go back to his kingdom. She's a nephilim now, which means she has wings and magic and a whole host of physical changes, and she needs to learn to use them before she makes a fool out of herself. For example, one of the first steps he takes in training her is to push her off a cliff so she learns how to fly for the first time. There's not really any better way to learn, but she's badly shaken and understandably upset. Also, she hates hand-to-hand combat and especially hates weapons training, both of which they're doing a lot of. He supports and encourages her, but is completely unyielding about the training, her diet, her education, and even her mannerisms and speech patterns. He does care for her, but his number 1 loyalty is to his crown and his kingdom. She has to be a princess first, and his friend second. While she understands this, she's not happy about it, and it starts causing static between them.

I meant for him to be sort of a hardass, at least when it comes to training her up, but I don't know if I'm crossing a line. I mean, even if she does have wings, I think pushing her off a cliff is just straight-up abuse. He's supposed to be strict, but not mean and certainly not abusive.

I think I’m pretty empathetic and I can usually put myself in my characters shoes, but sometimes it’s really hard to figure out how they’d respond and by using a mood board it just helps me to remind myself of their key characteristics.

Just something I found super helpful recently, hopefully it can help someone else too! :)",0
t3_bwe6zc,Using passive voice when the subject is unknown or unimportant,"I was dinged for passive voice when writing sentences like *'the rubble was being cleared.'*

In this case the subject--the rubble--is not performing the action--cleared. So it's passive, right?

But rubble can't clear itself. The active version of this sentence would be '*the rubble cleared.*' ??? Makes no sense. It's also progressive tense because the action is in-process, so if I use '*the rubble was cleared*' the meaning changes.

The real problem is the subject is whoever is *doing* the clearing, but this agent is unknown to the narrator. They could make an assumption, or use *'someone was clearing the rubble,'* but that leads to a question that honestly doesn't need to be answered. It's just an observation. The rubble is being cleared, the POV doesn't care who is doing it.

t3_bwn2fb,Want to make a story about a character with fire and ice powers but Todorki Shouto exists,"For those who don't know Todoroki Shoto is one of the most popular characters in one of the most popular animes My Hero Academia (or Boku No Hero Academia).

The problem is his powers are exactly that, his left aide is fire, indicated by his red hair, and his right side is ice, indicated by his white hair. And because his powers are so...simple it essentially prevents you from making a character with that combination without it looking like you've drawn influence from him.

And before anyone says, no, I can't just give him different powers because I'd already storyboarded, appeoximately 72% of the story before I found out this kid existed and I don't want to go through that hassle anymore.

It also doesn't help that Todoroki and my character are both incredibly similar in personality (because I'm good at writing unpassionate, cold people) so just fuck my life I guess  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0

Christianity can serve as the religion for the story rather well, but I'm worried about pushing a political message. As a result, I've considered making a new fictional religion to serve the same purpose, but after outlining the basics of the religion, I feel like it doesn't quite fit as well. Should I stick with my gut and keep Christianity in the story if I'm just extremely careful at making motives and right/wrong clear?

t3_bw2ar1,Overwhelmed with my fantasy novel,"Hello everyone.


I have finished a fantasy novel which currently sits at around 95.000 words. I have used the last months to edit it, twice, before daring to show my literary monstrousity to my friends and family. The feedback was generally good. An enjoyable plot with a satisfying ending that could possibly spiral into further books. However, I was also told they wanted more. They found the story evolving too quickly, and requested me to add additional chapters, building the characters and their relationships stronger. Also, they hated my main character and loved one of the secondary characters. I added three completely new chapters, fully set with characters chattering, and even introducing a new side character and a minor plotline. My main character has now been refurbished, and honestly, the feedback had led to the book increasing immensely in quality.


I am at the point where I feel satisfied with the story itself. It is tied nicely together, although it is not perfect. But what story is? You may ask why I am complaining on the internet, and the reason is that I feel completely overwhelmed. The book is long. I sometimes even forget certain parts due to what I assume can only be early onset Alzheimer's. How do you manage to edit a book without the assistance of a licensed psychologist? Every tweak I do, plot wise or character wise set in motion a cascade of events that triggers me to change small intricate details that keep me awake at night. I need help, and I need it fast. So tell me, kind writers, how do I edit something efficiently? Also, my writing abilities have thankfully improved since I set out on this journey. Every time I edit I feel I can do it better and better, perpetually stuck in editing limbo. 


At least it's fun.

t3_bw8t6j,First draft woes.,"I've heard a good few times that first drafts are like the worst version of your story, and that they're supposed to be that way.

But my WIP is well over 100,000 words now, and while I'm certain it'll be cut down and chopped and changed until it's unrecognisable, the sheer amount I've written, plus how much is left to do, is really daunting, especially when I know I won't use all of it. But I also know that finishing it is the most important thing, because then I get to go back, edit, make new decisions, change stuff, and make it something worth reading.

Here's the story; Noah is best friends with Shaun and Andrew comes into their life. Andrew accidentally kills Shaun in self defense and then flees. Noah spends the next six years tracking Andrew down because he thinks that Andrew is in some kind of trouble (because why else would he kill Shaun?) 

He claims that he's doing it for Andrew because he believes that Andrew needs his help. (Which he doesn't. He's trying to move on with his life.) Throughout the story, it is brought up that Noah is doing it because he wants Shaun's death to mean something. Like, if he never sees Andrew again, then his last connection to Shaun is meaningless. 

My question is: at the end of the story, Noah finally admits to himself that he is doing it for selfish reasons. I am aware that this change of heart comes out of nowhere.

I vaguely remember fanfiction.net, but I also remember that it's mainly for, well, fanfiction. I'm not too into the fanfiction side of thing, and while I do imagine that kind of thing, I prefer making stuff original, just like RPing OCs.

And also, how do you 'improve', and what's the end goal? I'm not talking like a purely economic standpoint, but writing style is much more abstract than artstyle, or music style.

Ideally, I would like to do a fully funded program where I can essentially write full-time and stay within that world. I write fiction, fantasy, and poetry. Up to this point, I have not had any real experience in the world of writing. English was always my best subject in school and I normally made great grades on essays and the like, however, I ended up getting a degree in Information Systems and going into the IT field for a few years. Basically, I have not taken any real creative writing courses and don't know anyone else who is a writer. 

From my understanding, the requirements for most MFA programs include, a writing sample, letters of recommendation, and GRE scores. I am currently looking into the GRE and I will definitely need to brush up on my math because I don't remember any of that, but I seem to do well in most areas on practice tests. I have also been considering taking some free creative writing courses online and trying to find some kind of writing community. I am currently working on a few of my fiction short story ideas, with some of them connecting into a larger narrative.

They also love my dialog, and tell me that I have great conversations between my characters.  Reading between the lines, I can see the one thing that's missing:  they don't tell me they love the slower scenes, which are supposed to create tension, suspense, or evoke emotions.

&amp;#x200B;

I think a lot of this is because I'm a good fast-paced writer, but need to work on slowing down.  I can handle fast-paced banter and I can visually manage a chaotic battle scene in my mind and put it onto paper, but I have trouble creating those tense moments.  I either blitz too fast through a scene and it doesn't carry any tension (similar to how a lot of movies today like in MCU or Star Wars will often use a joke to diffuse any tense scenes), or I end up with scenes that feel artificially drawn out by repeating myself or by moving at a snail's pace.

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, when I want the character to feel emotions or pain, it seems like either a flash in the pan, and onto the next scene, or it feels like I'm stopping the book to write a diary entry.

t3_bw9n3a,Looking for support: Avoiding thoughts on being narcissistic when creating a biography and advice on written style.,"I sincerely hope that I understand the rules of this sub and that I have adhered to them as closely as possible.

A little introduction.

I have not always enjoyed writing, but when I do, I don't feel I'm any good at it. I was diagnosed with Dyslexia and Dysgraphia at the age of 7, thirty years or so ago now, when Dyslexia was 'new'. I was tested and was told I had the reading age of an adult, I was beyond the testing upper limit. On the other hand, I tested with the written age of a three year old, at the age of 8.

Over the years, I've had many personal and developmental adventures which have lead to long term positive and personal changes. These are usually accompanied by some sort of significant change to my lifestyle.

Some examples of the changes it seems people are interested in:

Most recently, I have built a campervan by combining a caravan from the eary 90's and a heavily used ex-glasiers van. The idea was, and still is to travel and work around Europe for approximately 18 months, 'wild camping' through France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary through dangerous storms and incredible heatwaves. I worked for the whole summer in the Dordogne valley in the south of France as a holiday rep for very little money, before over-wintering at an interesting horse farm in the Pyrenees whilst making major readjustments to the interior of the van on an extremely tight budget.

Currently living in Norway after helping to build and then run a high ropes climbing course on the south coast. This was, of course after driving aforementioned campervan there through France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Denmark and Sweden at the end of the winter. I've been casually asked to write up, by the people I've met along the way, how I built the campervan, how I found places to stay on the way, where to find water, sanitation, and all the other things you don't know are 'things to know' when you live in a van for an extended period. Also, some of the people I've met along the way want to know what I did in the places I visited and what the places are like to stay in, for 'free'.

Prior to building the van, I left a 15 year I.T. Management career. I started working in I.T. from the ground up after changing tack immediately from art and design specialties in school and university. My first job was as an assembly and repair technician, my last was quite complex, Managing a team and several large projects in the Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices manufacturing and Intellectual Property licensing industries. I left them after coming through some mental health issues involving depression and my dyslexia, to follow my dream of becoming an outdoors instructor. Which I did. My peers said I should write about the transition, how it happened, what I did to become an outdoors instructor, what it is like to be one, and how they could do it themselves.

I've also been a medieval reenactor, traveling the UK in my spare time to show the general public how to make candles from beeswax and tallow, drinking lots of unusual alcoholic beverages, and making a few brews too!

""You should write a book."" 

I have many times, by many people, been told I should write a book. I love telling stories in the spoken word and have dozens of first hand anecdotes from my history.

I know *you* know it's hard, but here is what I am struggling with, why I am in this sub-Reddit.

I have started writing many drafts, on different periods of my life over the years, and usually come to a point when I realise, to myself; that the story is not very entertaining to me. I end up deleting, tearing up or neglecting and loosing the story. It is some time before I start ruminating on the idea of writing a book and subsequently catch the bug and try again. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Once or twice I shared a written short story to a friend or acquaintance and it appealed so strongly to them they convinced me to continue. I quickly lost confidence in my writing and stopped again. Looking back, I see that it is often because I *feel* it is such a narcissistic act, writing about one's self.

I can not see who would want to read what I am writing. Who would buy this? Why should I write more? Then I enter the thought pattern of ""I could be out doing more things instead of writing."" Lather, rinse, repeat.

What have I done to help myself?

To break this cycle, I worked on my written style following online pointers and a little training to help me become a more confident writer. This only served to remove what little confidence I had. I have now learnt that I use the passive voice too much and other such 'rules of good writing' which are usually the complete opposite of how I write.

**The point(s)**.

I suppose I am asking, if anyone here has been to the place I am, and what they did to break *into* the process.

I am passionate about sharing my experiences, but I am unable to picture the reader I am sharing them to. Is there any support available here to help with problem? I expect it is quite common.

I am suffering low confidence in my style of writing and struggle to justify 'breaking the rules', but the significant effort of re-learning 'good writing rules' seems insurmountable. Should I worry as I am about this, or blindly press on in my own style?

And lastly,

How to defeat the feeling that I am being entirely narcissistic in desiring to write a book about my view of the world and people I have passed through and spent time with.

Please be gentle if you can. It took a lot to get this together and post here. Written on mobile, please excuse mistakes, but I'm happy to make any corrections if you see anything absolutely horrific!

Thank you if you've read to the end.

t3_bw48m9,Complex Characters.," 

What is it about writing complex relationships that just feels so good? 

The villain isn't bad purely for the sake of being bad. He's been wronged and screwed over and made the bad choice while being manipulated. He's been twisted from the path he once walked and in turn has wronged others to benefit himself. 

The hero isn't the hero because fates decided it. She is the hero because she steps up to protect others that have helped her while struggling with her own guilt and pettiness.

The lover isn't just a lover because they fell in love at first site. Its the time they spent together and the joy and sorrow they suffered through. The yearning they have for that connection and the only source they know of it.

The rival isn't there just to be an obstacle. They can be a personal benchmark. But they are better if they want to get in the way. Jealousy and their insecurity over-ride the right choice.

I love characters that don't just fall into their role to fit. They have been moulded to it by the world around them. They are more complex and though I will likely never know their whole story. It's still awesome to see that little bit unfold",0

After leaving the first one untouched for a few months, I came back to it and realized that it wouldn't work as a standalone novel, and it would be better if the both novels come together as one. It is all good, as both MCs that have POV usually never share the same scene, that is, until the ending.

I'm coming close to the ending of the MC number 2 and in it he and MC number 1 share a great scene where one kills the other. I have already wrote that scene for MC number 1, and I really would like to write that same scene for MC number 2. Except I think it will get too repetitive and boring for a reader to read the ending from one character's perspective and then the same scene from another character's perspective after.

t3_bwe3hf,Writing Christian Literature,"I am beginning to write a narrative about a saint. I do not want it to be boring. I cannot seem to think of realistic faults or flaws for saints.

Will go to social events when invited. She enjoys plenty of wholesome hobbies. She loves children and animals and the elderly. She spends her time volunteering to help the needy. People dislike her because she is ""perfect."" She is a physically beautiful woman so she attracts the wrong kind of attention from men and women.

t3_bw5syo,Getting first draft finished.,"So far in my life, with the exception of my physics thesis, everything I've ever written has been 10 pages or less.  A science thesis is more focused on technical details so vocabulary and description is obviously not the focus so I was able to just get words on paper more easily, then start editing for content.

I've recently gotten the bug to write a non-fiction/sci-fi story.  I don't even know what exactly I'm looking to write, I just know I keep starting to write.  The problem is I end up spending what is probably an inordinate amount of time trying to perfect each paragraph as I go (like I wrote papers in college), but it takes so long that sometimes after an hour I have maybe half a page written.  To make things even worse I go back and read what I wrote, and start editing what was ""done"", before continuing the actual story.

My hope is someone who has dealt with this mind-set can give me some advice on how to just plow through the first draft without getting mired in the details.  I'm confident that I'm not the first (I don't think I'm so special to be experiencing something no one else ever has), and with a little luck someone can provide some sort of feedback.

She goes through things like dealing with trauma, discovering the horrors of the world, and realizing that she is a lesbian (and thus not in love with the man she was supposed to marry at the start.)

I never really considered writing in first person/past tense because I thought this was smarter, but I've recently found that a lot of people don't like present tense. I know I can just \~not care what other people think and do what I want uwu\~ but I've started to doubt my choice. It's associated with young and inexperienced writers (I'm 20), is considered clunky/awkward and limiting, and largely seen in YA. I don't want to make a fool of myself and badly write a story that actually means a lot to me.

I'm considering editing everything to be past tense but... that's a lot to do, especially if I decide that I was overthinking this. Also, I guess I don't really know how to write in this way and am anxious to do so.

So, I did a search and found nineteen instances of ""What do you mean?"" across my 90,000 word novel.

Looking at each of them, I find most to be awkward/extraneous - placed between two comments made by 'character A' largely to cue the reader that 'character B' is still listening, and/or to allow character A to explain himself/herself better.  Most of the instances seem ham-handed at best, a crutch to break up character A's dialogue.

I didn't eliminate all of them, but I did take out ten of the nineteen, reworking those parts - mainly allowing character A to just continue speaking.  I think they read much better now.

**EDIT:  Also search ""What?"" (with the question mark - another problem area of mine.)**

I recommend taking a look at this and judging how that phrase works/doesn't work in your WIP.  I was surprised to find I'd used it so often and am happy with the editing of them.

t3_bvo2qv,What I learned from self publishing/writing my first book and my second,"Hello!

I thought this would be a good thread as I have a bunch of thoughts on this. For anyone who remembers, I created a thread a little over 2 years ago when I self published my first one. For anyone curious you can view it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/65tyvg/finally_finished_and_released_my_book/



I am going to go over what I learned in both my writing/editing and of course the self publishing side as well.





1. If you read some of the first comments on that thread, you'll notice my first big mistake. I didn't thoroughly go through my book before self publishing it. In my excitement I went through it quickly and thought it looked great. Nah the very first page had a huge formatting issue and there were more on other pages. I scrambled to fix these and re-publish it. I ended up doing this a ton over that week alone.



So what did I do differently this time? For starters I set a release date a few weeks after my editor finished (this is a different editor as well, last one did a fine job, formatting issues I blame on myself for rushing). This allowed me to go over it on Amazon a lot. This time there weren't very many and I fixed them all in one day (extra spaces or a paragraph being too far indented were the common issues). Still I went through it every day until release. I am happy with how this went and will be doing this process for my third book.




2. One thing I never thought about when making my series is the book cover. Now I think my first cover was really well done, but that person couldn't do it again. So I found a new one and again I think my second cover looks good. However, one thing I hadn't thought about was the different type of styles that artists have. Luckily the one I chose was really awesome and made sure that both styles looked similar (in terms of text and all that). He did a little improvement on the first one so that it fit his style on the one he was working. I have made sure to save his information as I want to use him for all 5 books of this series.



3. I learned that I prefer outlining to just writing without one. When I wrote my first book without an outline I found it much harder to look up things I couldn't remember. It could be a character name, planet, when something happened, etc. I also found myself hitting a block as I wanted to think of what to start a chapter with. Do I go with this character or a different one? Or what do I want to happen specifically in this chapter? Stuff like that.
It took me a year in a half to finish the first draft of my first book because of this and it being my first book. I would have lots of days not hitting my word count as I tried to think exactly what would happen. 
This did not happen with my second book. I got an outline down in about 3-4 weeks and finished my first draft in four months. Yes you read that correctly, four months. I finished it a year faster than I did on my first book. I will continue to do this for a long time.




4. Now for my least favorite part of writing. Editing. I find this process tends to take me a lot longer than I like. I would say this is where I learned a lot and found a better process than my first one. First I will go over what I did on my first one and what improvements I made on my second one.



On my first one I only edited by re-reading the document and making changes as I read along. I also would read through the whole document, start over, edit, start over, etc. That was my process for the first one.
On my current one I did things a little differently. I still went over the whole document and started over, but I tried something new. I re-wrote the whole thing. I had the blank page on my main monitor and my draft on my second. I didn't just re-write word for word, that would make this process pointless. I found I was making a lot of changes I wouldn't have made if I hadn't done this.



I found myself extending scenes or shortening ones that needed it. I found myself more willing to make changes that I wasn't before. In hindsight I think I should do this more than once, something I plan on doing on the next one. I truly believe this helped my book a lot. Still this process took me eighteen months to do, but I think it was me getting lazy and making excuses not to edit or I wouldn't edit very much in a day.

t3_bvxcm2,Wanting to take on a co-writing project individually,"A friend and I did a small writing project together some time ago. We both came up with the concept and characters of the story, and began writing it with assigned chapters. It was something we were going to post online, so I made a website for it, a cover, etc. I spent a lot of time on the story, and I could tell my partner was slowly fading out of the idea. After a week or so, we abandoned it due to my friend being busy. I later find out that they felt far too much pressure trying to write in a pair due to deadlines and pacing, which I completely understand.

Ever since, I’ve been thinking about the story and what it had the potential to become if we’d continued. However, I’ve come up with a lot of new aspects of the story by myself, and would love to implement them. I’ve hinted towards my friend that I’d like to revisit our story when we’re both not busy to provide some sort of closure, and they haven’t completely ruled out the idea. However, I’d really like to write the story how I see it and by myself now. I’m a bit worried that they may have some sort of small attachment to the story (maybe less the concept and more the whole act of it, considering it was a fun time of bonding for the both of us) and that me asking to continue it by myself isn’t actually something I can do legally or ethically (this isn’t something I’d ever attempt to get traditionally published). 

Also, the legalities of it: if my friend allows me to take ownership/continue the project by myself and I do decide to post it online, do I need to credit them? How does ownership even work considering we both came up with the idea and characters together? What are my rights with this?

t3_bw0l9u,How to Hook an Audience," 

We all want to be known for our stories. We want them to travel, to affect strangers, to win recognition, but that only happens if our audience is willing to invest time into our work. Mature writers know that the greatest artistry reveals itself slowly, often only after a reader has committed to a text, relinquishing the initial nervous resistance and entrusting confidence in the author. Yet that hard-fought artistry is really what will earn us the regard we crave. So how do we get a reader to commit?

First, what *not* to do. Don't rely on some cheesy opening line. Here's one I recently came across in the weekly writing criticism thread:

""I ran away when I found ninety-five percent of my father.""

It takes pages and pages to figure out what this cryptic sentence refers to, and it never really pays off in a way that justifies its position as the opening sentence. 

What happens next in the story? Lots of running. So what should the author have opened with? Something that communicates the fear of getting caught. We don't need to know anything about a fractious father. If the next pages are handling the conflict of an escape on foot then the opening sentence should relate to that conflict.

So if not cheesy opening lines, what keeps our readers reading long enough for us to saturate them in our story?

Readers keep reading if they have a question that must be answered. They want their curiosity satisfied, and the best way to understand and maintain that curiosity is to view your narrative as a “what if” question. Stephen King is the best at what-if questions: 

What if there was a place that brought dead bodies back to life?   
What if the outcast became the prom queen?   
What if vampires invade a rural town?   
What if a father stopped protecting his family?

Each of these questions spurs interest. We want them to be answered, and so long as the text incrementally works its way through a response, we keep reading.

Of course, it's not just King. Here are some other great ""what if"" scenarios:

*Crime and Punishment*: What if a scholar murdered out of curiosity?   
*To Kill a Mockingbird*: What if a white lawyer defended an innocent black man in 1930s Alabama?   
*A Confederacy of Dunces*: What if a neckbeard had to get a job?   
*Forrest Gump*: What if a mentally-delayed man was serendipitously, unknowingly present at many of the 20th century’s most momentous American events?  
*Haroun and the Sea of Tears:* What if a storyteller ran out of stories?

The “what if” question does not only spur on the reader: it also spurs on the writer. A good writer has not answered this question either, until the novel nears its conclusion and the resolution becomes inevitable. If you set out with the question answered, you are writing propaganda, as Ayn Rand did with *Atlas Shrugged*, which disappoints with its dogmatic resolution.

What if a teenage boy developed acrobatic mobility, web projectiles and super strength? We still don’t know how it will turn out, and that’s great. Spiderman’s story is still being written, even as it transfers to Miles Morales. We don’t want the answer; we want the ride.

You will notice, also, that if the question is correctly formulated, it is asked in the very first chapter of the story and not answered until the final chapter. It not only encapsulates the primary conflict, but also our attachment to it and the trajectory taken in exploring it. I am currently rereading *Peter and Wendy*, and it is disappointing how long it takes for Peter Pan to enter the story. The first chapters are about how bumbling Mr. Darling refuses to take his medicine (It's not totally unrelated to the broader narrative: Peter Pan's central motif is that women are sensible and men are dopes). Consider how dreary *that* ""what if"" is: What if dad won't take his medicine? vs. What if there was a boy who never grew old? Is it any wonder we skip the first few chapters?

Please understand, the hook is not the value, it just keeps readers reading. It is the lollipop that barbers give to children to sit still while their hair is being cut. *To Kill a Mockingbird* is not a classic of literature because ""what if a black man was falsely accused of raping a white woman"". Many novels have asked a similar question to lesser effect, and any astute reader can predict Robinson's indictment. No, *To Kill a Mockingbird* is great because it enticingly recalls what it is like to see grown-up issues through the eyes of a child, not just racism, but house fires, drunkenness, ostracism, an uppity schoolteacher. Similarly, we all know from the outset of *Crime and Punishment* that Raskolnikov is heading for prison, either that or suicide, but Dostoevsky dares not conclude his ""what if"" until he has had enough opportunity to explore humanity’s dark nature, and it is through those psychological ruminations that the novel sets itself apart as a masterpiece.

So ask yourself, what is your “what if” question?   
Is it explored incrementally and exhaustively throughout your story?   
Does it begin right at the start, ending right at the finish?   
Is it presented enticingly?   
Is it answered conclusively?   
Is it a compelling enough question for readers to want to know the answer?

Get the right answers to those questions and the pages will turn themselves.  


\--

&amp;#x200B;

One final note: all of the “what if”s I have posed so far ask narrative questions, but other genres operate differently. A hallmark of postmodernism is that it poses “what if”s about the work’s very construction.

*Breakfast of Champions*: What if the writer became a character in his own story?  
*Maus*: What if the Nazis were cats and the Jews were mice?  
*Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*: What if a career reporter faithfully reported the experience of taking copious psychedelics?

These can be equally compelling “what if”s, and often the writer can even get away with a shabbier story because value is found in the work’s formal aspects, not the narrative.",0

t3_bvyr71,A quick thought on inevitability and struggle,"I just woke up from the tail of a dream punctuated by the worst of a deluge of feared experiences.

I stared out the window of a podunk trailer. Across the street, a Chevron and its gaspump lights at the corner of a strip mall. The couple big-boxes' glowing red signs were suspended in the wet night.

And a closed up drive-thru kiosk. It was yellow. It served hotdogs.

I had sat in the only bedroom, where my 59-year-old mother had piled whatever sheets and blankets and comforters she still owned onto a daybed tucked into the wall between tall and wide cabinets.

I'd asked what happened.

She'd said we'd be OK.

Given an unsuredness I've been a card-carrying member of all my life, I decided to leave behind the priority question of which corner of which floor would be my new bed, and walk across the small town. There was a comfort that everything was in its place, and an unease about mine.

I ended up two streets from where we live now. And I followed them down to a neighborhood, and a street, and a house that was still alive for me but also alive for someone else too.

Don't forget blind inevitability in your stories. Every minute of your hero's journey, an unexpected death occurs. They are as likely to wake to their mother having passed in her sleep as the people you've not written in your story. The house that used to be home still stands long after it's become someone else's home. I bet the front yard even looks the same, and they have their sofa in the same place.

These experiences are our toughest, greatest plot twists. They are unpredictable, and not because if we'd written our narrative with enough foreshadow they'd be any more predictable. They give gravity a run for its money, and they challenge us to juggle the blind inevitability that we are *not* in control so often. That we are all in a chokehold by our theories of fairness and individual power. And the sudden accidents and failures and loss, as well as successes and gains, can mean how we'd theorized we'd handle it becomes just a ""nice thought"" we had before stammering to put out innumerable fires.

Even a lot of the girls in school (who I still interact with 10 years later) cursed more back then as opposed to now. I'm well aware that about 90% of the time, curse words can be omitted while the sentence retains the same value, but I'm kind of sick of reading teenagers says ""freakin'"" when everyone knows they'd say ""fucking"". I guess the substitutes bother me more because of how inauthentic they come across. I'd rather books be like *The Outsiders* with no cursing *or* cheesy substitutes.

And then, when ""fuck"" is strategically placed in a one liner at the end of the climactic chapter, it's like devil horns appears above the word and ""dropped mics"" fall from the sky.

Is this strictly due to industry and genre standards which aim to reach a wider audience? Will a manuscript seem non-publishable unless the language is toned down? I'm currently writing about teenage skateboarders (I was one) and we were some of the most degenerate, foul-mouthed rebellious shits on the planet.

EDIT: Can't reply to everyone, but I read most of the comments and found the discourse very interesting. Some of them really had me laughing. Here's a summary of main points I collected from most discussions: 

1. As a business foremost, publishers care more about sales and reaching the widest audience possible, which includes parents and schools and libraries. I pretty much suspected this but wanted confirmation.

2. Stylistically, cursing teens may seem realistic, but can lose its effectiveness and become redundant very quickly. It is better saved for dialogue and using sparingly at that, whether it's used for emphasis or not. Realism has its place. 

3. There are plenty of YA books with an average or strident use of cursing. I was not aware of these before posting.",0

I have asked myself constantly about why the character's motivation would push him to do this, same for the enemies motivation. the cause and effect of said actions. What I, if I were a reader, would expect. But always come up empty-handed on how I could push the plot forward.

Now, I will admit. I am more of a discovery writer and I do like the story so far, the ideas established in the world are there. The characters are written up to a point where I am satisfied with (For a first draft at least), maybe adding or refining their traits in the second draft would help and though I would like to spend more time casually fleshing out the protagonist's character, the problem of length would come into play.

t3_bvrudq,Looking for advice on how to continue my story,"I'm currently working on an outline for a fantasy story I want to write, but I feel like I've written myself into a bit of a corner here and I don't know what the most plausible way for my story to proceed would be.

Basically, there are three rival kings in my story. One of them is the former queen, outcast, who has just gathered an army and is now travelling to reconquer her homeland.

The second one is currently hauled up on an island between the outcast queen's location and the current king's location. He is an exiled high lord, having fled after he killed the royal heir (the outcast queen's brother). Several of the high lords of the country these kings are fighting for are conspiring to get him on the throne, as there are no other suitable heirs and his killing of the royal heir harkens back to an age-old tradition where potential kings would fight to the death in a duel for the crown. These high lords want to restore stability and see this exiled lord as the best candidate for king; the tradition thing is more of an excuse for them to justify their plot.

The third king used to be the most powerful lord of the land and crowned himself after the outcast queen fled. He has gathered a massive army, consisting of the army of every current lord of the nation, although half of them are planning to abandon him and take their armies to the exiled lord they are plotting to crown. They were planning to do this as the navy housing the armies would approach the exiled lord's island, quickly taking out the king, destroying the army from within and joining with the exiled lord to fight the outcast queen.

However, in my story the king will be murdered by a disgruntled lord right as the navy would leave for this island. The lord, already suicidal, would then allow himself to be killed by the king's guards. Naturally, the most logical sequence of events would be that the king's son would become the king, but I am struggling with what the conspiring lords would do. They were planning to betray the king at a much later point, but what do they do now that he has unexpectedly already been murdered? Do they accept that the king's son becomes the new king and travel with him to the island? Do they just take their armies and leave, leaving the new king behind? But if they do this, then why, story-wise, did the king need to be murdered in the first place?

It is really quite important to me, thematically, that the king be killed by basically a random lord who was already suicidal and just wanted to go out with a bang. It fits with the kind of Game of Thrones-esque theme of my story, that theme being that power resides where men believe it resides, kings aren't infallible, and sometimes you just die because someone makes the decision to kill you. I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to make the king's murder more consequential for the story as a whole? How do I make his death more relevant?

(I also hope I gave a well-enough explanation of the story this murder would take place in, but do ask questions if necessary)",0

t3_bvoiqj,Documents within a story,"Asking here since I couldn't readily find information when I looked it up normally. Basically, what is considered acceptable when including fictional documents within a story that is not otherwise an epistolary novel?

Some background: my original plan for the story in question (and something I hope to still manage eventually) was to have it be a psychological horror exploration game. The main inspirations were Corpse Party and Fatal Frame, the latter in particular being what inspired the use of documents and location flashbacks to show the history of the haunted locations. So a lot of the backstory, even some of the important bits, would be seen only as notes, diary entries, or imprinted memories.

This reliance on documents within the story is the primary thing keeping me from creating a novelization of the story's main ending. Since I've been prototyping the game for years without finding something that feels fun, I was considering using a different medium to tell the story. But I'm not sure if readers would be willing to read about characters who are reading every document they find. Even if it didn't feel so meta, I feel most people aren't interested in the horror equivalent of a book club. (There's a reason most detective novels don't show every article or book the lead combs through for clues.)

So I guess my ultimate question is whether it's possible to write a decent story with a lot of documents as part of the story. (Including being read by the characters, not just for the audience like in Carrie.) If not, I may just write a story bible for the game until I figure out a way to make it fun.",0

t3_bvjtrg,Physical character descriptions in fiction writing,"Hi guys. I'm aware a common tip for character introductions is to not go through a bullet-point style checklist of physical traits. 

I've recently read the manga **Jojo's bizarre adventures**, where characters' appearances are integral to their design and the storytelling itself. While this isn't exactly novel in fiction, it does so to a very high level of detail, and are typically very *unique*. My question then is how might you describe a character's appearance and clothing in detail to that extent. Or potentially, how do you reproduce the same effect that bizarre clothing have on the character's identity?

My thoughts are either: 

1. Don't try and imitate as illustrations are a different medium to written. Instead touch on key points that are critical to the character's design.

2. Try my best at making the descriptions as evocative as possible so it's still interesting to read.   

Any examples of good character descriptions are appreciated.

t3_bvngcf,What is a good criminal conspiracy for a fantasy story?," 

Re-posting due to getting no response last night. (sorry if that goes against Reddit etiquette, I'm still new)

I have this story that takes place in a mostly non-magical medieval (kings and knights) fantasy setting. To add a little context when I say mostly non-magical I mean no spells or fantastical creatures/species though there are a few enchanted magical items from a distant past where wizards were a thing.

The main focus of this story is meant to be the building of a friendship between the two main characters but there is an action-ish plot as well. Basically these two go on a quest to find an item and on the way back they stumble across a criminal conspiracy. They at first think is one small operation only to discover soon after that it actually goes way deeper and a large part of the nobility of this kingdom and several others are a part of it.

My current trouble is figuring out what would be a good criminal conspiracy. My current thought is slave trade but I’m not certain if that would be seen as all that bad/unusual for a medieval setting. At the beginning of the story there is a lot of mention of certain trade numbers that are higher or lower that is meant to imply the conspiracy. I know I want the first book to end with them only having uncovered a part of it and it being heavily implied that one of the main characters fathers (the king) is turning a blind eye to it and if he goes home he will be surrounded by enemies with no way of knowing who they are.

I want something pretty morally unambiguous that isn't a world changing event in of itself. For example I don't want it to be dragon smuggling or anything that adds magic to the world. Cults would be fine as long as it isn't something connected to bringing magic or a powerful entity into the world. Also something relatively SFW, so no explicit sex or anything.

Does anyone have any advice on what the criminal conspiracy should be and some ideas on how I might want to approach it?

The same applies to the words I use. If I use words that are too complex or jargon-y, my readers will have a hard time understanding my writing.

t3_bvj5pw,Acceptable Levels/Places of Exposition,"I'm currently outlining a sequel and was looking for a bit of advice when it comes to exposition. The sequel is set about 2 and a half years after the first story, which ended at the declaration of a war (it's in the high fantasy genre if that helps anyone). The war is almost over now and the main characters have been fighting in it pretty much for the entire two and a half years.

The story essentially starts off with the news of one of the last resistance city-states having fallen, and so the characters start preparations for an assault on the final citadel of their enemy. Obviously a lot has transgressed over the past 2+ years, including some vital information about the enemy, which city-states were destroyed and what sort of position the MC's forces are in.

In my first draft I loaded all this exposition into the first chapter to essentially make sure readers were caught up on the gap between stories, however re-reading it all I've realised how bloated and convoluted it all is. The characters just move from eating, to strategising, to getting dressed in their battle outfits for the day. It's boring and nothing really happens besides the info dumping between characters.

So my main question is how long can readers generally wait before starting to wonder what's going on (in a bad way) and getting bored or confused? I want to spread this exposition out across the first 4 chapters now instead of jamming it into just the first one. I'd like to have the info relayed through the characters as well just FYI - as opposed to me rambling on about it through narration and internal monologue. The first story is written in this style so I'd like to remain consistent.

The way they implement lore from different places of their world especially most of the time the way Martin does just amazes me and it really gives me the (sometimes overwhelming) feeling of just how big the world can be in a fantasy story.

However, thinking about it made me question as an unpublished, amateur, yet of a hobby writer, that how much are people really amused about the lore behind that not by all means directly connected to the main plot as I am and would it be a turn off for some people.

I don't mean to overshadow the story and dumping it in or write endless paragraphs or dialogue about it, nor a huge amount of info dumps and certainly not start off the book with it but rather weave it in as a means to show that there are things outside of the main events in the world in small bits.

Would this be still acceptable and not daunting for the reader, as I presume not everyone like to get that void filled in about some of the mysteries about the world as I'm.",0

t3_bvk7a3,An issue I have trying to write short stories,"Something I realized now, trying to write short stories, is that I'm trying to connect them to bigger stories I want to do in the future. Even if I'm using characters that'll be used in later stories, I should keep these shorts self-contained somehow. I feel this way because I don't know what's allowed to be published. I don't know if I can write a partially self-contained 10+ page short that hints at future events. This is, unless I start writing random scenes  and events that could happen, and mash them together to make a whole. Each being a sort of short that I can meld together.

This is probably why I have jackshit done and am not writing as fast as I should (that, and the fear of the lack of imagination or creativity). There is another short I want to start soon, a horror inspired by some indie-games and the short film the movie ""Mama"" is inspired from. A short I doubt would span anywhere near 100 pages. Something I could publish in a mag or something, but I feel I'll just try to connect it to something I haven't done yet. I don't know if this is something that is an issue.

**Edit:** This is, of course, assuming I don't self-publish, but that seems more difficult to me. More difficult to get yourself out there, even though it adds more freedom.",0

t3_bvb4mt,How important are personal experiences to the quality and authenticity of a fiction writer's work?,"Say there is a talented and enthusiastic young person who aspires to become a fiction author (not me). Would it damage the quality or authenticity of their work if certain experiences are fundamentally lacking or different in their life (e.g. they suffer from certain disabilities, mental illness, social isolation, etc.)? Do they have to draw inspiration from and allude to their own personal experience so as not to come off as inauthentic even if they don't want to or could they still create \*any\* sort of fiction they want authentically using only their imagination?

The difference in life experience doesn't even have to be all-encompassing, for example, can someone write authentic romance if they've never had a romantic affair? Can someone create authentic depictions of the socially and economically disadvantaged without having lived through the experiences themselves?

I may be naive, but I expect the answer to be neither a firm yes or a no. On the one hand humans share a common set of experiences and our imagination allows us to empathize and identify with even the remotest of these human experiences. On the other hand living through a certain life experience lets you notice details and subtleties that might otherwise be overlooked when experienced vicariously and that may be needed when it comes to recreating those experiences authentically. And people's individual experiences shape their character to be biased toward one thing or another.

It'd be great by the way to know of real world examples of people who've attempted or succeeded at this (I wouldn't be surprised if I get something like ""all of them"" as an answer, but I'd still like to know about the specifics).",0
t3_bvhj9t,Which is the best option for this character?,"I'm writing a book and I'm really stuck on this one thing.

So, there's this character (we'll call him Michael), and throughout the book, the reader needs to really, really love Michael. He has a beautiful heart and helps the main character (basically saves her life at one point, is able to be completely selfless and do what's best for her instead of himself, etc etc etc.). Then, at the end of the book, it's revealed that Michael was a psychopath the whole time and did some really twisted, evil things behind the main character's back. **The reader can't be suspicious of him at all until they discover the truth at the very end, though. I can't emphasize how important it is that he's loved by the reader. The ending needs to come as a total shock.**

So, my question is this. Which option is best?

1. Michael's been a great person his whole life, and he's still a great person throughout the whole book
2. Michael did something bad in his past (nothing *evil*, just something bad), but he grows a lot throughout the course of the book and redeems himself, and by the end (when you find out he's evil), it still comes as a shock

I'm so conflicted because both options have huge cons. If he's a great person throughout the book, then it'll be boring and predictable (oh wow, the nice guy's been evil this whole time, soooo surprising!!!), and there's no opportunity for character development. However, if he has a rocky past, that might make the ending predictable, too (of course he's evil, look at that bad thing he did!!!). HELP.",0
t3_bveykw,YA vs Adult Standards,"Hey guys! For awhile I've been contemplating whether or not my novel would be suitable for the YA market. I've read a lot of posts stating that YA is strictly an age category, books about teens *for* teens, and that if characters are 18+ then it would be categorized as adult.

Basically, a book of 13-18 years olds can be categorized as YA or adult, but a book of 18+ cannot be categorized as YA. My characters are 20-25, meaning if I want my book to be YA I'll have to age them down. I do not enjoy writing teenage characters, my book has some dark themes and when I read YA I find myself scoffing sometimes at how unrealistically easily teenagers handle dangerous situations, since it wasn't long ago that I was a teenager (I'm in my early 20s now). I'm not saying that teenagers can't handle difficult situations, or be wise beyond their years, but I myself really don't want to write them.

Anywho, I recently read a negative review of a book on goodreads that is categorized as adult because of the age of the characters. The reviewer stated something along the lines of 'it felt less like an adult book and more of a book exploring adult themes through a YA lens', mainly pertaining to lack of character depth, proper worldbuilding etc.

Other than age, what defines an ""adult"" book then? Hypothetically, if I were to submit a query to an agent that only accepts adult and then to another that accepts only YA, is changing the age of a 19 year old main character to 17 the only thing that I have to do? Are there higher standards for an adult manuscript vs a YA manuscript?

This is more of a general discussion question, not specific to my book.",0
t3_bvcyr5,Editing whilst you write?,"I'm currently sitting on about 5,500 words of my novel, and whilst I fully appreciate that it's a lot in the grand scheme of things, for someone who regularly restarts projects, this is quite an achievement for me. Also factor in that I'm actually pretty pleased with them, and it's an unusually good time for me when it comes to my writing.

There's a few things in these 5,500 words that I'm not 100% happy about, and I was just wondering if it's best to carry on moving forward and getting the whole story down or address the problems whilst they're fresh in my head.

t3_bvhfq2,Am I screwing myself out of a chance of ever getting published?,"Recently I started posting bits and pieces of one of my stories to my blog: snippets of chapters, ideas on where I'm going to take the story, etc. However, I keep hearing about how a lot of publishers generally don't want stories that have been published in any other medium than through their publishing company, making it near-impossible to do so if things have been posted already online. What I have posted is less than 5% of the overall story, but I'm worried that even so much as talking about it online will one day screw me over and keep it from ever getting published if it's something I decide to pursue (which in of itself is something I'm not sure about with this story anyways).",0
t3_bvgct1,Stuck! First Chapter sucks!,"Last year I decided to write a book. I came up with what I thought was a great idea, sat down, worked my ass off and knocked out a first draft in 3 months. Completely full of myself, I decided it was good enough to query. Sent it off to maybe 15 agents, and out of those 15, I got maybe 3 full requests, and 1 or 2 partial requests. Nothing panned out. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I started to think maybe I wasn't so good, so decided I probably needed to edit. I paid a lit agent for feedback on my first 10 pages, and she basically said that although there was a market for my book, it was boring, and in her opinion, I could practically cut almost all of it, with suggestions on where to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took a brief break away from it at that point, so I could have a fresh perspective. A few months later, I re-read it, and could tell it definitely needed a lot of work. I'm now on my 7/8th draft on the first chapter, but I still feel like I haven't made much progress in actually making it any better. I've had several beta readers read it after each draft, and while I think I get mostly solid advice/feedback, I just feel like I keep changing it, but it's no more interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard for me to come to terms with, because a few years ago when I was in school (English degree) and heavily immersed in reading/writing, I felt I wrote some of my best work. Now, I feel like my writing is forced and it doesn't flow as well. Forcing myself to write doesn't really make it eloquent or as natural sounding as I feel it was before. I'm at a loss for what I can actually do that will help me write these first pages (not to mention the entire novel) so it's not boring people to death.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice on what they think will help? Should I just take another break? Read a shit ton more? My husband is suggesting I take a writing class, but I don't feel like they will teach what I actually need, which is how to tighten up/help me make things flow better, but maybe there is one that can help with that.

t3_bvg9m2,Literary Agent Question - Am I on the right track?,"I’m from the UK, and here is my situation: 

I have written a compilation manuscript of short stories, poems, and two personal posthumous letters to my dad and mum. These are arranged in such a way that despite the various genres, and moments of time, they are held together by an element of the story or poem that preceded the next.

I have thus far sent out two proposals to two different literary agents and both have said, in layman’s terms this phrase, “We absolutely loved your work, but it just didn’t meet our tastes.”

My questions to you, fellow writers, is two-fold:

1. Is my writing good as they claim?

If so:

2. Am I on the right track that I simply need to find an Agent who can represent a long term business relationship for this and future works (that are not compilations)?

t3_bveyyy,Accidental time travel scene- advice/opinions???,"Hi, folks! So I've been finally drafting a novel I've had in the works forever. It revolves around a young man possessed by a spirit who sends him, his brother and their family friend back in time to 1876 Wyoming (then Nebraska Territory) to avenge his death/put him to rest/???

One aspect of this story I didn't anticipate being difficult to write was the characters' reaction to being sent back in time. The possessed one knows that they've time traveled but not how to get back, but the other two MCs have no proof that they've been sent back in time and are confused and unconvinced. However obviously, they've got to become convinced eventually (preferrably quickly). For some background, they end up in a small frontier town after being taken in by a friendly villager- it's the only town for miles around. 

Does anyone have any creative ideas on what might eventually convince these characters fully without having to make it too much of a 'thing' that they're convinced? I don't want to have to sidetrack the plot for this. It's very much a magical realism/surrealist novel, not meant to make a WHOLE lot of sense, but this part feels important and I so far I haven't been able to make it feel 'just right'.",0

t3_bv1n5s,Why you shouldn’t ask for critiques before your story is finished,"A long post coming, since I’ve seen a lot of people asking for critiques after writing the first few bits of a longer project.

We’ve all been there. You write your prologue, first chapter, whatever it is. You’re excited, and just want to show people. You want opinions on your writing style. Most of all, you just want to talk about whatever you’re writing.

Don’t.

I see it here all the time, and my advice (while admittedly blunt) is always the same. Put your head down and keep writing. Don’t show it, and don’t talk about it until it’s finished.

Why?

Because once you share it, it’s no longer just yours. You’ve put it out in the world, incomplete and raw. If people like it, you’ll get the inevitable sense of satisfaction, effectively killing the drive to finish. Or if people don’t like it, they’ll criticize it and suck all the life and excitement out of it. It’s always a lose-lose, and when I see so many people questioning what’s making it so difficult to finish their novel or story, after asking questions, they admit to having shared their first chapter or two. That rough draft is for you, the writer, and if you really have a burning question about a very specific plot point, a close friend.

Besides, you should go through a fairly significant number of changes from your rough draft. What you’re asking people to critique might never make it to the very next version, or you might change it to the point where it’s unrecognizable. It makes their time editing and your time pouring over their corrections a waste.

So, hold onto your big project. Hold onto your first few chapters. Your writing style is probably fine, and if not then it can be edited when there’s a full novel’s worth of context, not just a couple thousand words. Your idea is probably fine, too. It’s what you do with it that matters, and without the rest of the novel, those first chapters don’t hold much weight.

Just some personal advice from someone who has been there before and sees it even more often. Put your head down and finish the rough draft, and let that first copy be for your eyes only. Have some ownership, and stay strong. We’ll be excited to see the completed, edited draft.

EDIT: Seeing this a lot, and so I understand not all advice applies to every writer. Any advice, including mine, is meant to be taken with a grain of salt. That said, I still think this rule applies to most. Beta reads are not alpha reads, and first draft=worst draft. If you can’t take the word of random internet dude, then listen to Stephen King. I’d venture to say he’s pretty good at this whole writing thing.

And no, this does not mean I’m against you having a close friend or two to confide in during the early writing stages. I have them, as do many, many published authors. It’s good to have people you can bounce ideas off of, and that’s different from asking for widespread feedback. Your rough draft will change more than you now know by the time you complete your second. Just addressing some common disagreements and my arguments toward them.",0

t3_bv8rfe,Those of us with rather busy lives - how do you find the time and energy to write? And! How do you stop yourself from going into *too* much detail that isn't needed?,"Hiii

First post on this sub. 

Basically, I love writing. Always have. And damn it, I'm rather good at it when I set my mind to it! 

My problem is - I can never find the time, and when I have the time, I never have the energy. And if by some miracle I have both time and energy - it ends up that either I'm not alone (I need to be alone while I write. I get too easily distracted so the only other thing I can have when writing is background music) or something comes up that takes priority. Let me explain... 

I have two smalls under 5. I may as well have a 3rd, but however, he is my SO and 30yo. So naturally I'm running around like a blue-arsed fly every day of my life. I also have Fibromyalgia, which means I'm in constant pain and have a constant lack of energy too, due to using up all my spoons.

(spoon theory. In a nutshell, this means you start your day with X amount of spoons. Takes 1 spoon to get up and get dressed. Then a further 2 spoons to make and eat breakfast, etc etc. Eventually your spoons run out for the day and you end up borrowing spoons from tomorrows ration if you need to. This means that you start tomorrow with LESS spoons, and so on and so forth)

Now, not only am I in a lot of pain with very little energy by the time my kids are in bed and asleep, the lack of energy + pain = brain fog and difficulty concentrating. 

My partner comes home from work at approximately 10pm too. So, I have roughly 3 hours between kids being asleep and my SO coming home. Within those 3 hours, I need to sort the house out from the chaos that is 2 childebeasts, prep and make my SO's food, usually I need to shower at some point in this timeframe too. Which leaves me roughly 30 minutes to myself, every day. In those 30 minutes, I need to recharge myself. And I usually do that by mindlessly scrolling on my phone in my garden with a hot coffee and a cig. And due to my partners unsociable working hours, when he comes home that's the time for us. We discuss our days and essentially be a couple until we go to bed. 

So, I realise that the Fibro thing is kinda a thing reserved for the sufferers of said condition (and similar ones!), so that aside - where the buggery do I find the time to write, with my brain in good working order? 

I also ramble. A lot. (As you can probably tell). On the odd occasion I can actually sit down and write, I find that I go in way too much detail that isn't necessary. For example, the last time I wrote, I described the weather, decor of the room, the kind of day, how my character got out of bed and did her morning routine, described the character, AND THEN went on to go into detail about the town she lives in. The town thing, yeah, it's kinda important to the story I want to put out there, but the sheer amount of detail wasn't needed and neither was anything else. It just wasn't needed for the progress of any of the characters. I ended up deleting the whole document because... yeah. It was shit basically. And it upset me. This was about 6 months ago. Does anyone have any advice on how to notice what you're doing BEFORE you do it too much, and how to pinpoint details that are important and not just descriptors, just because I've lost myself in the scene in my head? I think my problem is that I want people to envisage what I am in my mind and I focus on that too much and it takes away from everything else I'm trying to portray. Does that make sense? If it does - how can I achieve that, but in a good way?

But man, I miss writing. So so much. I want to start again, it's just all of the above stopping me. I have all the ideas floating around upstairs in my brain, I'm just struggling with putting them into words. Which is something that I never had an issue with ever until this last year or 2. 

Help? Tips? Advice? Anything?

My protagonist is someone that can be sympathized with, but he most definitely has is moments where the reader is not supposed to like him. I won't go into all the details about him so this post isn't a book. 

I have decided to write it in the first person since that is what I'm most comfortable with. However, I'm just not sure how to keep the reader engaged with his story. He has a violent side to him, but I don't want to show that side of him all the time to keep readers interested.

t3_buzot3,What's a good way to go about having your main Villain redeem himself?,"I have an old story series going on that basically involves your classic recurring Villain trope- the Antagonist is the arch nemesis of my Protagonist, and he has tried get through her many times in order to execute his many different evil plans. - Which mostly involve him trying to take over Eloika (their home). While there are a handful of other villains, he is, of course, the most prominent one.

So here's how the relationship between my Antag and Protag goes- he and my Protag are bitter enemies for a while, but eventually, they come to respect each other as rivals. The Antag eventually starts to express a form of sympathy towards the Protag- for example he stops one of his high ranking henchmen from killing her at one point. He also intervened when another villain attacked the Protag- kind of showing a ""Im the only one who can fight her!"" attitude.

In short, without his rival, this Villain just wouldn't know what to do with himself. As for the Protag, she has a degree of respect for him too. If either of the two characters were to die, the other one would likely be mournful- perhaps even out for revenge if somebody else killed them.

As the timeline progresses, the Protag gets married and has a kid. Of course, while carrying a baby, she can't really fight. The Antag decides to hold off on any further evil plans due to not being able to fairly face his rival, despite protests from his minions. Nevertheless, the Protag begins to search for someone who can take her place as the Hero while she is out of commission. I think that it would be an interesting twist to have the Antag take her role- at this time he is really the only one in Eloika who is powerful enough to effectively take her place. It would also provide me an opportunity to write a part of the story that follows him and his development instead, and how he handles playing hero versus the Protag. But, before this point, he would likely need to be at least somewhat redeemed.

&amp;#x200B;

So now that Ive given some background, I want to talk about how I should redeem my villain. What reasons should he have to turn away from evil-doing? If he were to temporarily take the Protag's place, how could he get the people of Eloika to trust him? Should he even do it in the first place? Also, what would he do once the Protag is back in the game? Would he go back to his old ways, or decide to permanently change for the better?

I have some ideas here- But i would like some help building on one or more of them!

\-Maybe hes simply surprised at the Protag wanting him to take her place while she's prego. And then while he is taking up her mantle, he actually *wins* a few battles, and decides that playing hero is better.

\-after numerous defeats at the hands of the Protag, he decides that it's pointless to keep going on as the Villain. Plus, at this point, its likely that the people of Eloika -and even readers- no longer take him as seriously as they used to.

\-Maybe he and the Protag defeat another villain together, and realizes that he and her make a good team.

\-Something happens to him that makes him rethink his past actions.

\-Maybe he is not redeemed yet, but still agrees takes up his rivals mantle as a sign of respect. That could be when he discovers that playing hero is better- Or, he could use this as a chance to divide Eloika, and gear up for another Battle for Supremacy with the Protag, once she is back in the game. After this battle is when he could enter the path of Redemption.

Either way, this villain would also have some sort of ""Journey of Atonement"" along the way. Maybe he atoned before being recruited to take the Protag's place, or maybe this taking of her place *is* his Journey of Atonement.

&amp;#x200B;

Im hoping all this makes sense, sometimes i suck at putting my thoughts into words haha. So how should I go about this? Should I even redeem this villain? How should I go about it if i do?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, if he did redeem himself, some other villain would likely take his place as the main Antag.",0
t3_buy2e2,Starting out tips. Should I wait with doing something big??,"Hey Reddit

This is my first post here :)

Im 18 and I really really like the hole story/world building idea, with deep background stories. I mostly like reading fantasy since i've grown up playing games related to that topic. I've been wanting to start writing for some time now but I feel like I might start out with something to big for a ""beginner"". I started creating some story ideas a few weeks ago and here's the problems I had.

1. When i want to make an indepth description of an area or a enviroment, I have all these ideas in my head on how it looks, but when writing I feel like it either is too short but makes sense or its long but feels like im just writing on description after the other. (like a list)
2. I feel like I need more depth in my story, like an ongoing background story but I find it hard to combine to stories. Lets say i'm starting out with to people walking in a cave and they are looking for something, then I want to introduce the world to the reader and the background story and then get back to the cave story. How do I do that in a smooth way? I know it's diffrent from story to story but in general what do you keep in mind.
3. Doing multiple stories at once, like in the GoT books, switching pov. How would you do this? Just chapter to chapter or are there other ways to make it seem natural.

Im pretty much looking for tips in general, when building a world, creating a large storyline and ofc just writing fantasy

t3_buwxia,"I have a very ambitious novel series idea, but lack the writing skills for it. Your thoughts?","I’ve been working on building an original idea that includes many elements of fiction I’ve always wanted to explore. So far the setting is set, the maps are drawn, the rough main plat arch is set and the main characters are more or less defined. I’m still working on the smaller details and the history of the setting, and sketching the animals and vegetation of the planet. I’ve even wrote a start of 20k words on it.

Now I’ve been reading lately and I’ve come more and more to the conviction that my language skills and especially my descriptive skills are far away from being even close to adequate for the job I’m planning to do.

While further reading and making notes to develop my skills.

I’ve also had an idea of maybe writing these first books in the same universe I’ve planned for, just a simpler more compact story arc than I’ve planned? This way all my work will belong to one universe and not all work will be incoherent? I still haven’t decided.

I feel something similar happened in one episode of Love, Death &amp; Robots, only it was on the opposite end of the temperature scale (that was more like cauterization by freezing when the astronaut had to break her own arm off in space.)

Regardless, it's a desperate scenario. It wouldn't happen if there were other options.

2a. What are some things you can do to further advance yourself as a horror writer? I know publishing books, maybe writing a script, and submitting a story to a blog, but what are the other options in the horror universe?

3a. Do you have any general tips when it comes to writing horror?

Writing in general questions:

1b. How do you keep up your motivation to write?

2b. Does writing a fan fiction serve any potential profit or exposure? I have been working on one (not related to the novel) but Im not sure what to do with it afterwards.

3b. Do you archive all your short stories for your own personal enjoyment or do you try to submit them to magazines, blogs, ect?

4b. Everytime I decide to take a break from my book (which seems the only thing my mind wants to keep working on) I work on short stories. However, I lose motivation and rather do my book instead which leads to half done short stories. Anyone else familiar with this feeling?

5b. At times I feel like writing is pointless, I do it regardless because it makes me feel like Im doing something productive while having fun. What keeps your mind away from these ""pointless"" moments of writing?

6b. Final question, I am reading Stephen King's book titled ""On Writing"". He talks about when he was younger he would sell his short stories and submit them. What could he possibley mean by this? I feel like my short stories have no purpose but to float in Google Docs. Where could I submit one?

I know my questions may conflict with each other, but most of these are questions to confirm what I know (or at least think I know) and to pick up some extra tips. Sorry if there are some typos, I am currently typing this at 4:30 am. Thanks!",0
t3_bv1is8,Redeeming the Irredeemable,"Backstory: I wrote a trilogy (unpublished). In this trilogy, the MC is in an abusive home where he lives exclusively with his uncle , the abuser, and his cousin, who has never left the room he was born in. Long story short, the uncle dies at the end of the first book. MC isn't exactly happy, since he's not sure HOW to react. His Uncle is one of the only people he ever knew and with his death, now the MC has to face the world he was never prepared to face. The second book deals with him moving on from what his uncle did to him, and the last book ends with him, almost twenty years after the uncle dies and he has a family, at his uncle's grave and forgiving him and coming to peace with the home he grew up in. (He also learns to forgive his mother, who IS still alive, who left him in that home when she knew what was happening, and his little brother, who he wrongly blamed for a lot of what happened to him.)

&amp;#x200B;

Discussion: I've had a couple beta readers who have disliked how I handled the arc of the MC and his uncle. Throughout the first novel, the uncle was a bad person who was conflicted about what he was doing, with a side character who was trying to see him as something other than evil. So, my question for you is how do you handle an arc like this? I'm hesitant to call it a redemption arc, since the uncle was never redeemed, the MC just forgave him (which, it is implied that his spirit could move on after the MC's acknowledgement of forgiveness.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you like arcs like this? Is it bad to portray this kind of relationship? What are some of your experiences in writing arcs and relationships like these? Would you consider that a redemption arc, and should writers even try to redeem characters that should be ""irredeemable?""",0

t3_buxkdf,Advice for wrapping up a story that you wrote on the fly,"I am sure that this is a relatively common problem, so I thought that I would ask for some general advice.

I recently wrote a short story of a little over three thousand words. Without giving away any plot details as of yet, it is some surreal genre fiction that sort of straddles the line between fantasy and science fiction. I shared it with a few others in stages as I wrote in, and they seemed to genuinely really enjoy the atmosphere and scenery of the weird little scenario that I laid out. The first two thousand words or so are largely solid, I am told.

My problem is that I am having a lot of trouble coming up with a satisfying ending. I wrote this story on a whim, without really thinking of any deeper character motivations or lore before beginning. Is there a general rule of thumb for the best way to pivot material written on the fly into something a story with a coherent ending without entirely reverse-engineering the entire story?",0

t3_bv0bni,Advice on writing Canadian French when I don’t know any French,"Three of my werewolf characters are from a Canadian pack before they join Pack Massena in northern New York.

These characters are Crispin (male), Meredith (male), and Remina (female).

Crispin isn’t actually from Canada, he’s from Vermont, but he lived in Canada long enough that the other characters say he’s from Canada as a running joke in the story.

Due to the proximity to northern New York, I’m planning their previous pack to be from the Ottawa/Montreal area, maybe Quebec.

What type of accent would these characters have, if any? I know that not everyone has one.

When it comes to the language, which dialects are spoken in those areas?

I’m looking to have Crispin, Meredith, and Remina use French phrases or pepper their sentences with French words. Idioms, terms of endearment, and slang words (including Canadian English, too) would be appreciated.

Feel free to include anything else you think I should know, as I want to be authentic and avoid stereotypes. Thanks!

t3_butb9y,My fanfic has over 180k reads. A few of my friends are telling me I need to market it. I have no idea what I should do with the audience I have.,"Unlike most fanfics, the work I write is completely original. It’s in the setting of an established franchise, but the plot/characters are all original due to the fact that my fic is a rewrite of a popular  (or once popular) fantasy series. 

All I would have to do is change one name and the name of the world/realm the story takes place in, and the body of work would be completely original- so it could easily be updated to be free of trademarks/licensing issues. 

   Some of the people who have read it have been telling me to “market” the story to editors or publishers- but I have no idea what that would actually entail.

t3_burfws,What should be your first chapter?,"I've been writing for a year or so now on one project and I have rewritten more pages than I care to admit. But the most frustrating for me is to decide where to start. My first chapter has been rewritten I think at least 5 times, and I don't mean revisioning, I actually mean top-down rewriting that changes the whole course, or at least a great deal, of the story to follow. My issue with this is probably unsolvable, at some point you have to decide what is good enough to start with (otherwise you can keep searching for a good chapter and regress back to the beginning of time as to explain every inch of history). At least I made some advances, I now structurally I set-up a clear antagonist and a protagonist. Now the question remains how to start, and with who?

  My question to you, however, how do you decide what's a fitting first chapter?",0
t3_buzwh3,The trope of The Light,"Something that has started to feel like nails on a chalkboard for me is that fact that The Light is so often used to represent good and The Darkness for evil. Aside from a lack of originality of hero fighting ""for the Light"" or ""against the Darkness"".

In personal discussions I have gotten three main responses to why this theme is used so often:

The first is that we cant live without the light. This is true in the sense that we need light for plants to grow and to help us create vitamin D, however, we would suffer equally from a lack darkness. Without darkness we would not be able to sleep and continuous exposure to sunlight is very bad for the skin.

The second response is that it is based in religion,  such as in the Bible when God created light. That seems contrary to me since if a god/goddess had to create light then it would imply that they existed in darkness prior, and unless I'm mistaken, the fallen angel Lucifer is known as the Lightbringer.

The third response is that darkness creates fear, a fear of the unknown. But I dont see how being afraid of something should tie it to evil.

From personal observation it seems that often people who are corrupt in the real world will portray them themselves as being ""of the light"".

So...

I was wondering if there are any good books in which forces of darkness (good) fight against the Light or at very least seek a true balance between the two.",0

I was planning on her slowly regaining her memory by having her interact with the antagonists, protagonists and by her having internal conversations with the demon itself.

I've got an end planned for her but I realise that I haven't really thought through how she would regain her memories without it being sentimental drivel. Her resurrection makes her more brutal since it was her showing compassion to an enemy that got her killed in the first place but I'm not sure if she should be a total amnesiac, partially or just saying that she remembers everything in her life pre-death.

t3_buxx92,"So many ideas, what to do?","So I am just starting to write again after stopping because of mental issues, and in the years that I refused to write my brain has filled to the brim with ideas/concepts. While this is ultimately a great thing, it also means that when I do write a story, I don't particularly know what I want it to be, because it could be anything. I feel like I have a vague idea, until I start writing and then my brain tells me ""Lol, But what if, though?"", then it starts to mix with another idea I had. Maybe it comes from being uncomfortable with the idea itself for the character. I don't know. I even struggle with writing small pieces because of this. This is why one piece I was doing weeks before became longer than it needed to be. But I feel I could use this to my advantage somehow...

Okay, so recently I've been wanting to focus on smaller pieces, actual smaller slices of stories for practice, that I could possibly later use for longer works. It would also help me build these fictional places for Michigan without the added stress. Well anyway, I'm doing one that is based off two characters I saw in a dream I had a few years ago, and inspired by a piece of art I found a month ago. 

In this dream, this guy and this girl seemed to be on the run together, think Leon: The Profession (The Last of Us also comes to mind). For this short, I'm trying to figure out how they met (which I think I got down), and what both of them are dealing with that causes them to go on the run. At first, I thought she was apart of a gang, using her for something. Then I thought that was cliche, then I thought that was stupid to think. Nothing is original, but I can make something uniquely own so I need to get over it. 

Then I felt...What if she killed someone? Not with malicious intent, but by accident, and it turns out this person was important. Until I remembered another idea I had, that would make this girl a serial killer. The guy could be involved in gang-related things but decides to take her in. 

What kills me is that... I get attached, and it would break my heart to do that to this kid, but it feels like it could *possibly* work. It would lift me right out of my comfort zone for sure. I have to remember that I'm not writing for my comfort. 

I don't know, but what I do know is that I'm rambling. Sorry bout that.

t3_buxr33,Too much cause and effect in my writing - nothing unexpected happens,"This is a pretty big thing that's plaguing my writing right now.  I'm having a difficult time setting scenes up because they always feel too contrived or convenient to me.  I like it when my stories have consistent internal logic, right?  People doing what they're doing for a reason - it lets me add in twists or plot elements that don't make people raise eyebrows and ask me ""so, what ELSE are you going to pull out of your ass?"".  But right now, by sticking to that idea of internal logic, I'm having trouble making the story go in any direction but straight ahead. 

&amp;#x200B;

It really wasn't until I started playing an old favourite video game that it struck me that I was limiting myself.  A character would find a key item on the ground.  Or a villain would make an appearance at just the wrong time and ruin the hero's plans of escape.  Or somebody would drop something, or the hero would jump into the car at just the right time and barely escape the villain's clutches.

I wanted to avoid doing these things because they felt too contrived.  They felt like cheating, like I can just hand the solution over to my heroes any time I want to by having the villain drop something important, or a collapsing building reveal a secret passageway out of the burning town they're trapped in; of *course* they'd be in just the right collapsing building at just the right time to escape, right?  I thought, ""I can manage to make a story interesting by just making the internal logic clear and making my characters and the setting *follow* that internal logic.""  But they're no.  It's too strict.  Nothing interesting is happening.  Everything feels like a chain of cause-and-effect, and I learned that not a lot of interesting things happen when you don't insert some sort of curve ball.  Cause and effect is meant to be the heroes reacting in-character (and the story reacting in-setting) to a disaster they couldn't see coming.

How do I add these plot elements and make my story move forward and be more interesting to read without doing it wrong?  Because I've read plenty of online short stories where this is done wrong.  I've read stories where the hero drops something he needs just before he needs it, because otherwise the story would end right then and there and something *needed* to happen to keep the story going.  I've read about the villain overlooking a massive flaw in her plan, allowing the hero to waltz over to certain victory.  I've read about the trapped heroes enraging the guard into entering their cell and then leaving it so angry that he forgets to lock the cell door behind him.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My big question here is: how do I make interesting things happen in my story (the hero finds a key item on the ground; a collapsing structure reveals a hidden escape route to take them away from the burning building they're in; the villain make an appearance at just the wrong time; etc) properly and without it being too contrived, cliche, and/or deus ex machina?  How do I do all this without making my readers roll their eyes and wonder, ""what is this guy gonna pull out of his ass THIS time?""  I would really appreciate any advice you guys could give.  You've already helped a lot with how I write my characters, but now I need to learn how I write a story.",0

t3_buugga,Question for fictional story I'm writing that involves Filipino characters.,"&amp;#x200B;

In my story there will be a backstory to the protagonist's parents and I want to know if any of this sounds offensive at all. I may have that the mother of the protagonist as a child was a refugee from a rural village in the Philippines and as a child she was found and taken in by this secret organization where she was raised as a super spy agent and years later she ends up meeting an American caucasian man and has a child with him which produces the main protagonist. The thing is the mother would already of been half white half Filipino to begin with, which would then make the protagonist only a quarter Filipino. This would be because the protagonist's mother had a white father that was in the Philippines and as a child the mother was grown up in this village.

I may have another option and have it that it was the protagonist's grandmother that was a Filipino refugee at the time in this village who was taken in and trained as an agent, meets an American man years later and they have a daughter that is half American/Filipino and then that daughter would meet an American man which would then make their child the main protagonist a quarter Filipino.

I understand that the sweet spot for this genre is normally 80k with a max of 100k for fantasy fiction, and I am concerned that even after editing the word count will be off-putting for editorial agents.

t3_bup9qy,Kids can handle violence so long as you don’t go over the top,"Okay recently I watched the original watership down and I got scared at how bad it was. I haven’t felt so scared at a kids movie in a while, specifically at the part where holly describes the Warren’s destruction much like a gas chamber he barely escapes. It was hard to sleep that night. I think the only thing that really scared me in the recent past was Wormy’s close up and the realization that shell city is the same as being locked up in a room with dozens of your dead family friends and neighbors at your feet. 

But I watched the netflix adaptation and I realized that even if it had a good idea, it was awful, specially the first episode. The violence is significantly toned down and that kinda ruins the idea. For example, the destruction of the Warren in the book is darker than the movie. In the book, many of the burrows get filled and gas gets pumped in. One of the rabbits has to claw through dead bodies to get out. Men peck the dead rabbits out with sticks. And if a live rabbit gets out, it gets shot. In the movie, same idea except there’s no shots and no sticks, but there is gas. 

In the Netflix version, we never really see or hear what happens. It’s implied that what happened was they dug up the burrows with shovels and just moved all the rabbits, as in a dream we do see the Warren get destroyed that way. But that takes away from the gravity of the situation. Yeah the Warren got destroyed, so what? It couldn’t have been that bad then. Yeah they lost their home but many of the characters we met in the first pages are all gone. 

The reason I say this is because toning it down ruined it. It’s like saying that kids can’t handle it, and the whole point of watership down was that the rabbits had to face strife and hardship to find a new home and it ultimately pays off in the end. 

One thing I love about works for kids is that they manage to be mature but also able to talk to kids on their level. Lion king specifically showed mufasa’s death and the fact that Simba is plagued by Mufasas legacy so badly that he can’t save his home and I got that as a kid. Jungle book faking us out with Baloo’s possible death was touching. Meanwhile, the giver outright shows Jonas’s father kill an infant. It haunts me more now, as babies can’t move or talk so they can’t fight back, but it still haunted me in the seventh grade how chill he was doing it. You can influence an entire generation with your works depending on what you write and who enjoys it. 

So I think it is possible to put violence in a kid related work so long as it’s in there as long as necessary and gets the point across. Transformers prime explored the idea that good and bad don’t exist at times. Megatron wasn’t evil from the get go, he had a point to demand freedom, but because he got there through fighting alone and he grew up in an environment where you taunted others to get what you wanted, he became an evil hypocrite. Meanwhile, somebody like airachnid was a torture specialist and killed whoever she wants so long as it serves her but even she thinks the human/cybertron robot cylas is way too far and even pays debts. 

The reason I say this was apparently watership down wasn’t for kids, but because animation at the time the movie came out usually meant so, you had to make it for kids. It still haunted me and all that hooked me into it was the scene of holly relaying what happened at sandleford with absolutely no context to it. 

Also you should do it depending on the age. For example if you write for a toddler, you obviously shouldn’t have a character die onscreen or show how it happened. Or you can’t have a character be raped and then have their throat slit. You can imply it and even say they died but if you do show a death don’t make it graphic. With Mufasa for example he didn’t have a scratch on his body. And for something like a series of unfortunate events, they merely imply Olaf is a pervert (or a perverted troll). In the book, Violet even thinks it’d suck to have to sleep next to him each night but never wonders about sex. It still gets the point across it’d suck either way.

It might sound hypocritical but don’t go overboard with the violence. Kids can handle violence but don’t just do it to do it. But if you’re writing for a family as a whole, you can do a little more, but again, be sure you have a purpose beyond traumatizing your audience for kicks. 

Violence in a work, especially for kids, can showcase maturity, but if you do it too much, it’s like putting swear words in an academic essay. Or it’s like watching Schindler’s list and putting poop and fart jokes in all the most dramatic scenes, like the ghetto’s liquidation or the women in the showers.",0

t3_buv01k,How Might a Secret Be Revealed?,"Out of all the communities, I'm part of, this one is the most helpful. I love reading posts in this group.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm reaching the half-way mark of my story, but realizing that I need to get the ending sorted out first before I can continue. I had planned out the whole thing - but I'm not entirely happy with some logistics about the ending.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of the book, a traumatic event affects the lives of three of my characters who are children at the time. (Let's call them D, C and M). Although ""D"" gets halfheartedly blamed for the event by his parents, he actually has nothing to do with it.  


Fast forward a few years when they are grown up and the event is still impacting their lives, ""M"" starts to blame ""C"" for the event. It becomes a big secret in the story. Toward the end of the story, it's revealed that M was actually directly responsible for the event - all throughout the story the reader has no idea.

It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow. The story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls, knife in hand, weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife's slain body in his arms.

t3_butqfh,Having trouble forming characters,"This problem is basically a first for me. I have been writing stories since I was a kid. Never published anything just wrote for my own amusement and I was always a pantser. Characters were the easiest thing for me to create and let run wild. I was just along for the ride documenting their adventures. So, when I had to take some elective classes in college, creative writing seemed like the obvious choice. Unfortunately, it didn’t go well.

My teacher basically insisted on us being plotters not pantser and it totally disrupted my creative process. We had to first create a world. She would give us a paper with about 20 questions about the world and that had to be filled out. Then she would have us fill out a detailed plot structure; what’s the exposition, rising action, climax, etc. Then she gave us character sheets that asked a ton of information about each character that had to be filled out. Finally after all that, we were allowed to write. I struggled at first to find stories that fit into the little box I was confined to but I made it work. I cranked out a few good short stories but was ultimately burnt out by the time I was done with the classes. 

Now I’ve been hit with some inspiration to write and I’m finding it to be difficult. I keep bouncing between being a pantser and plotter. It started with an idea about two characters but I found myself trying to world build instead of just start writing. The more world building I did, the more I lost my grip on those two characters that originally inspired my idea. Now I’m sitting here with this amazing world built and a fairly solid plot idea, but a loose idea of who my characters are.

 1.Avoid was, no more than two per paragraph.

Below is the sentence in question: I gripped a line that lead to the sail and nodded. VS I gripped a line leading to the sail and nodded. Is this a big deal? I'm sure i've alternated which one i've used throughout my 95,000 word historical fantasy novel. 

3. Just a note on how detailed my writing should be, is this a case of show vs tell. Editors note: Why would we make this assumption? Why would it scare him? Just a thought..   

 The sentence in question: The hairs on the back of my neck stood on end, but I was relieved the voice belonged to Melvin and not Cutler. Melvin was our friendly oarsman who spent most of his time below deck. He didn’t talk a whole lot so the cannonball must have scared him. I replied, “It’s me, Will. Sorry about the noise, a rope snapped.”

It's the fourth one I've found interesting. For her I set a rule that I can't use any form of ""It is"" or ""We'll"" ""We will"" etc. Unless it's unavoidable.

t3_bu1ns4,"A discovery about the use of character names, something all striving writers need to pay attention to.... Avoid name switching!","First off - credit to /u/Setisthename for giving me this information.

Premise - your character probably has a first and last name.  But in your writing, you should stick to one or the other and not switch back and forth (outside of quoted dialogue).  You should avoid 'name switching.'

Did you know that in the entirety of 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' Harper Lee NEVER refers to the main character as ""Finch?""  She always refers to him as ""Atticus"" or ""Atticus Finch.""  There is not a single instance where she writes something like *Finch turned toward the jury...*

Did you know that in the entirety of Casino Royale, Ian Fleming's great James Bond novel, the word ""James"" is only used 16 times, and only when the complete 'James Bond' name is used?  It's *Bond did this* and *Bond did that* - never something like *James said....*

Wow.  In my novel there are a dozen characters, and I switch from the first name to the last name all the damn time.  For instance, my villain is Walter Peterson.  It's *Peterson stood up* and then two paragraphs later it's *Walter sat down.*  On and on - across all 90,000 words I 'name switch' like this - and I did it deliberately, thinking I was avoiding repetition and aiding the reader.

Once /u/Setisthename pointed this out to me a couple weeks ago, I've been going back in and correcting everything - it has been a massive undertaking of 'find/delete/replace' - hours and hours of work.  I sure wish I knew this literary rule before I started.  Guess what?  It now reads better - it makes a big difference!  I actually still have a couple questions about it and would love to ask them in the comments to anyone better versed in this than myself.

Pick a name.  Maybe you use the first name, maybe you use the last name.  But pick one and stick with it in your narration, outside of dialogue.  Ignore the urge to switch it up.  You will confuse your reader and lose the flow of your writing.

With one or two lines in Geordie, I could translate, but I can't think of a way of doing all of it without it being tedious for me or the reader.

t3_bumcna,How do I bring myself to write about heavy subjects?,"I've been spitballing this idea for a story for a couple of months if not two years, now, and I've finally settled on a plot that is far darker than what I thought was the darkest it could get, but it fits all of the criteria I want in my story (e.g. narcissism caused by isolationism and the culmination of aimless resentment). 

I honestly may have trouble writing this plot, not just because it is so much further down the rabbit hole than I thought it should be, but because I don't know how I could extend such emotional evil through an entire book.

Basically, it is about how narcissists need to be punished to realise their misdeeds (different to all other types of people who require careful rehabilitation) and that narcissism is deeply routed in blaming problems on exterior forces, which leads to a secret self-hatred that causes the narcissist to lie to themselves to justify not taking action.

I have two halves to this book planned, the first half being the character's inflammation of his ego through aimless anger, and the second half being a journey to realising it is all their fault through a cruel, accidentally self-inflicted punishment. 

If there's any advice or even anything someone could say, I'd be hugely thankful.",0
t3_bue76r,What are some tips and tricks of writing a gothic story?,"I am working on a project which requires a short Gothic story (5 pages at least), and I am a bit uninspired. I had only written dialogues containing the Gothic elements.

t3_bum570,I'm worried my prologue will leave readers disappointed,"Well hello there! 

I'm planning on writing a novel that features a villain pretty similar to Voldemort. In Harry Potter and in my book the villain is ""killed"" before the book begins. 

I'm planning on writing a prologue that, if I was to write it for Harry Potter, would be Lilly running to fight Voldemort (which isn't exactly what happens in HP but ties closer to my book). Lilly is convinced that she can defeat Voldemort and save the world. However, once he appears in their home, she loses all confidence and knows that she is going to die. The prologue ends before Voldemort kills her, and chapter one begins eleven years later when harry goes to the zoo.

I'm concerned that I'm going to disappoint my readers by doing this. This is because I introduce this incredibly scary, bad ass villain that distills a huge amount of fear in the only character we know. I think it should be really exciting, but then we cut to ten years later and that bad ass villain died during the time jump. I'm afraid that the readers won't want to continue reading because that villain isn't a character anymore (even though he is just as alive as Voldemort was in Harry Pooter and the sorcerer's stone). 

What are your thoughts on this? Of course I am eventually going to give the information of how he dies as the book progresses, but it will be more in flashbacks. Would you want to continue reading the book if you only saw what was in the prologue, and then saw that the villain was dead?

Thank you.",0

t3_buh1z9,Advice on converting my screenplay to a possible novel,"Hey guys, 

just for fun, last year I wrote a Disney-style screenplay that came out around 80 pages long, and contains three full-length songs. The problem is, of course, that screenplays for animated features are near impossible to get produced. You need a huge budget, a production team, etc. 

BUT

I really like the characters and the story, so I thought I should convert it to book form. The problem HERE, is what type of book? It'll be for children/teens obviously, but a picture book would take a lot of the detail out of the story. 

Do you guys think I should make it a full-blown illustrated young adult novel, like around 40-60,000 words? And as a secondary question, do you think there's demand for fairytale-like stories? (Mine is very much like a fairytale; it centres around a lost princess returning home)

t3_bu6wff,I'm ecstatic! My main character's motivation changed and caused a major rewrite of my plot.,"It originally started as a story about healing. My main character is found broken both physically and mentally. Over the course of the book she heals herself by helping repair the damage done to the realms and putting an end to the wars/stopping the bad guy. She decides to stop moping and be proactive to prevent others from going through what she went through. It's deeper than that, but you get the gist. 

I'm 27 pages in and had a realization. My MC is changing. Instead of a story about healing, it's turned into a story of revenge. She started out staying with her rescuers because they were kind to her. Today while I was writing I found myself writing that she was staying because they were after her enemy. As soon as the bad guy was killed, she was going to kill her rescuers. 

This has thrown my entire plot into a bit of chaos. It still works, but it's going to need some heavy editing. Things that happen from a place of love now happen to further her plot to ruin everyone. 

Honestly, I'm enjoying it. I finally understand what people mean when they say that sometimes your character doesn't do what you want them to. She's becoming 'real'. I'm ecstatic! I've never had this happen to me before. Instead of dragging myself to write through my first draft I'm eagerly sitting down to see how things change. 

 I hope that the other people around her do the same thing. Rewriting my plot to be a revenge story is a pain, sure. But I think I like it better this way.

t3_bukdmb,Thoughts on retcons,"Writing fiction, whether it's for a short story, a novel, or a screenplay, almost always centers around your audience's suspension of disbelief in order to tell the story.  Even in a realistic story, you're making up fake people, or using real names to tell fake stories.  The requirement on the audience to suspend disbelief grows, as the author changes history, or tells something in a completely science-fiction or fantasy universe.

&amp;#x200B;

However, the rules and history of that universe must remain intact (unless time travel is involved), or you run the risk of having a plot hole.  A plot hole that is intentional, in order to tell a different story or a sequel, then becomes a retcon.  Most plot holes can be ignored willingly by the reader, in order to at least finish the story, but the thing about a retcon is it largely becomes the story.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have a main character in Book 1 who grew up in a lovely home, and I forget to have him call his parents when he's in town, that's a plot hole.  In Book 2, if he's suddenly an orphan, and the whole plot of Book 2 is him finding his parents, that's a retcon.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes it can be explained away by the expansion of the universe.  ""The demon"" can be ""a demon"" because you discover more of them.  ""All ghosts can be killed with salt"" can be subverted if you meet more powerful ghosts, or realize you were only temporarily banishing them.  ""Wands are required for magic"" can be a rule taught to 8 year olds in your universe, that 12 year olds will figure out how to do magic without wands.

&amp;#x200B;

But in general, a retcon just opens up a huge plot hole, and it's even worse because it's done intentionally.  My experience has been that a retcon will take me out of the story, because at that point I don't care.  

&amp;#x200B;

When I am reading a book, I love to see the world that is built, and to imagine myself there and what I would think and do when I'm there.  What would be my favorite class at Hogwarts?  Would I be strong enough in The Force to be a Jedi?  I learn about the world through the story, and I want to know more about this world.  If the world suddenly changes, now I don't know what's real or not *within the context of the story*.  Star Wars is certainly unrealistic, but I know if I were there, I couldn't just point a stick at someone and say ""AVADA KEDAVRA"" and kill them.  Harry Potter is also just as unrealistic, but I also know I wouldn't have a droid with me at Hogwarts (even if they existed, they wouldn't work).

&amp;#x200B;

So why do authors retcon so much?  Why do they take a story and world I'm invested in, and change them, to the point it's more work to try and figure out the rules than the value gained from the rules changing?

&amp;#x200B;

In regards to discovery causing a retcon in what we understand about the world, that's world-building and makes us feel like we ARE learning more.  But in regards to most retcons just being a ""I didn't like what I wrote before so I changed it"", it feels cheap and makes me care less.",0

t3_buoqu8,There is no true way to write a manuscript so long as it makes sense,"I say this point blank:

write whatever feels natural but be sure it makes sense and is easy for the reader to understand. At first, I always went with you had to do chapters and they couldn’t be long, but I’ve been exposed to a lot of books that are unconventional: game of thrones changes personalities of characters depending on which viewpoint as Ned could go from a slightly sexist honorable guy to a complete hypocritical asshole when Jaime narrates; in as I lay dying, chapters can be as long as ten pages or as short as a sentence. 

I do suggest you don’t do it standard, as it can be creative. I had a character whose mind was broken so her chapters were often super stilted, ended abruptly and had massive spelling errors. Her sister had long run on sentences because she overthought. 

But don’t just do it to do it. Be sure it has a purpose. Moll Flanders didn’t have chapters because it was just a transcript of moll talking to a priest. It didn’t have chapters just because the writer wanted to waste your time. Because I will admit, I hated moll Flanders and the way it was written didn’t help. 

Don’t just include spelling errors, be sure there’s a point to it. In as I lay dying, the in universe reason is because most of the characters aren’t that bright, but out of universe it’s because Faulkner didn’t really revise it. 

It also helps your work to stand out if you write it uniquely. James Patterson usually has his books include hundreds of chapters much like a movie. Even if you can argue he’s a ghostwriter at times (if it’s say him and Suzanne Collins chances are Suzanne wrote the manuscript and he wrote the outline) you can still tell the book is attributed to him.",0
t3_bujs8a,"Attending a ""Publishing"" Workshop before Book is Done?","Hello! I'm looking for some advice. There's a ""How to get Published"" workshop coming to my city soon that looks interesting.

I was just wondering if anyone has attended a publishing workshop like this and found it useful for improving their book as they're going along, instead of after the fact?

But also, would it be useful to see what I should include in my first few pages before writing them? Or would I be wasting my time by attending this before I have a final product?

Basically, in the story, this character undergoes psychosis constantly throughout the story which often sends him into fits of rage and panic. This character knows very well that something is wrong with him and he desperately tries to cure himself with his own sanity slowly corroding.

A lot of his struggle revolves around the people around him such as his friends, family and love interest as he is conflicted because he needs them just as any person needs their own friends and family but he still needs to keep them at a distance to ensure that he doesn't become a danger to them.

I know that some writers tend to make characters with mental disorders just for the sake of being edgy with no clue of what it's truly like to be in the shoes of a person with this condition and I hope to avoid that by making a character that in spite of his disorder is still relatable and is a character you can feel sympathy for all whilst being respectful of people who have actually experienced psychosis.",0

t3_buino3,Lexical question on bind vs. bond,"In my werewolf story, there are three types of bonds, or psychic connections, between individuals.

Pack bonds link group members, pair bonds link mates, and soul bonds are reserved for linking mages and their mates.

Pack bond becomes mindbound to someone, pair bond becomes heartbound, and soul bond becomes spiritbound.

However, since bind and bond have different (but similar) definitions, can I do this?

In my previous writing, I used bond and its hyphenated forms, but it became tedious at times.

Yet, without previous story context, the single word bond/bonded could be left with an ambiguous meaning if read at random. I wanted to fix that, and so I developed the above terms.

t3_buae1r,Is there an online writing platform that supports tagging of chars/locations/etc. and generates maps/plots based on those references?,"I've found that Fictionary more or less does this, but it's limited to having a user-accessible database only for characters, not locations or anything else. I want to see locations, etc. also accessible in the same way characters are. Additionally, the software is really designed for editing, not writing, and has other limitations. I think that, essentially, I'm looking for a combination word processor and relational database interwoven into a wordabase product. Bonus points if it has inline comments because that's a rarity (which I don't understand).

If you're not sure what I'm talking about, think Scrivener's tags. Now, instead of manually clicking and dragging stuff, what about just typing (since that's what we're already doing) #charname or #place and having that automatically linked back to the database entry of whatever that is AND have a map of scenes/chapters/etc. that shows where those things are mentioned based on those items being referenced. I mean, I'd take click and drag if that was around, but I can't even seem to find that.

* Detailed the order and importance of the events (X gets attacked, triggering Y, making Z do...)
* Checked and double checked that there's nothing weird going on regarding who is where and when.
* Triple checked that the rules of the magic-system are adhered to and that nothing that's being used hasn't already been seen or explained before.

So, as I sit down and start writing...

And I can barely get out a handful of simple and very short phrases for the fight scenes that should bring about a far greater level of impact.

&amp;#x200B;

Help! Just how can someone ""buff up"" the sensation a fight scene could carry that doesn't involve three pages of being inside the character's head?",0
t3_btxh2u,"Just some reminders to newer authors, whether starting, novice, budding, or otherwise...","1) It's ok to be going through writers block. It happens to every author, whether new or experienced, unknown or well-known. We all go through the phase where we can't keep writing the story, where we can't figure out the next step of it. If it's holding you back, save the story for later, for writing at another time.

2) The stories we work on don't always flow right. They won't go where we want them to all the time. And that's perfectly natural. Don't get discouraged that it's not going the 'right' way, that it's heading in another direction than you wanted it to. That is what helps make the story feel real, letting it flow in it's own way. As long as you have it set with where the story ends, eventually it will reach the conclusion, and it might gain a lot to the story if you let it flow it's own way.

3) Don't get rid of stories that don't work. You can use them as influences for other works. We all have stories that we think will be great, but end up being bad (don't confuse those with stories that we get too critical of that we write, we are our own worst critics after all), and we can use them to help with other works.

4) There is nothing wrong with taking a break. Whether it's from the current story to work on another, or just from writing in general. We need to live our lives some, spend time making ourselves happy, appreciate what we have, or just take time to think. Take a break if you need it. Just don't forget to get back to writing. It is like a muscle that needs to be stretched to keep it working right.


These are just some tips that I wish I had been given years ago. There is obviously more, but I hope that this helps others. Also, please add more tips as well, since I know there is so much more to say.",0
t3_bu9fyf,Naming Chapters versus Saying “Chapter 1”,"Hey all! Just a random question here. 

When it comes to writing &amp; chapter titles what’s your preference? Do you prefer to simply call it “Chapter 1” (or 3, 7, etc.) or do you like coming up with specific names for your chapters? 

Also, when reading do you have a preference? Does  reading “Chapter 5” come off as lazy and/or signify a lack of creativity to you?

EDIT: Thanks for all the input!",0
t3_bu1db6,Coming to terms with the fact that I'll never write like Michael Chabon,"I finished my second novel several weeks ago and have been going through cycles of beta reading, critiques and second-draft revisions. It's gut-wrenching to focus in on all my plot and character weaknesses, rip out stuff I loved and re-write critical sections for clarity. But even after all of that, I'm now left with a novel that's... y'know, kind of entertaining, but not the literary masterpiece on par with those of authors I love.

Something I've been coming back to over and over is this thing that Ira Glass said:

&gt;“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I  wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it  because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple  years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good,  it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work  disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.  Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years  of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want  it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or  you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most  important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a  deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by  going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your  work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out  how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s  normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.” 

Ugh.

t3_bufmuk,Help with my Big Bads level of aggression,"My main antagonist goes through a series of 5 challenges so to say. In each one he has two conflicting voices basically telling him what to do. Think of it like the angel and demon on each shoulder but in the form of other characters. 

In the first situation he terrorizes a group of people and that is it. During the second he has begun to escalate, terrorizing and injuring people. At the third situation he now terrorizes and kills people. In the fourth situation his ""demon"" is missing and I am having trouble coming up with what kind of de-escalation would be appropriate. 

The fifth and final challenge his ""angel"" has been killed so he goes off the deep end. No terrorizing just a straight up bloodbath rampage. 

My intentions are to show that his demon is the ultimate cause for his escalations to a point. He is still my antagonist and still a bad albeit troubled big baddie. His fourth challenge is the first time he attacks people without his demon. What do you think his level of aggression would be?",0
t3_buac43,"How do I motivate, folks?","This is probably just me being a lazy bastard, but my motivation is TERRIBLE! I know, I know, ""write your way out"" and ""the only way out is through,"" but... what if I never even went in in the first place? I just really need help pulling up the Google doc, sitting in my chair, and having a GOOD, SUBSTSBTIVE FUCKING SESSION!

t3_bu4a4b,A question about how other species may perceive breasts.,"I'm trying to gage if this idea of mine is too wierd to bother with. I am plotting a story where a female lizard person goes to a human city for the first time. These lizard people pretty much look like monitor lizards standing on their hindlegs, so there aren't any major features distinguishing genders, like breasts. The female lizards don't feel the need to wear tops or shirts all the time because they have nothing to hide. 

So this female lizard goes to the main city. The humans thinks she's a guy because she's not wearing a shirt, much to her ire. She has no concept of breasts, because that's a mammal thing, so she thinks those lumps women are carrying around on their chests are actually large poison glands, because why else would they have large lumps?

Is this too weird? I feel like I can get some fun out of this idea, but I'm swinging back and forth on whether or not this is too weird. The story isn't going to live or die on this idea, but it would add some fun worldbuilding.

Edit: Just to address some questions, this lizard person came from a small village where mammals aren't too common, so she's not familiar with mammal physiology, let alone human anatomy. The city she goes too has a lot of fantasy races walking around, so a giant lizard isn't too out of the norm. People would assume she's male and move on with their lives.",0
t3_buanar,How important is perfect grammar?,"I'm not a native English speaker. I learned English till high school, but learned more English from reading and movies.
