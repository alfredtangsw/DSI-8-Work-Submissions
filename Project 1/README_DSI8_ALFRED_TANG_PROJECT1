## Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016, intended to prepare students to join the workforce as skilled and educated persons.

**The re-design was intended to:**
1. Encourage higher participation by:
    - making the test more transparent
    - removing penalties for incorrect answers.


2. Better prepare students to take on college educations by:
    - giving students specific areas of study to focus on
    - ensuring student readiness for college by setting new benchmarks for the new test structure

**Key questions:**
1. In which states are participation rates increasing after the re-design? 
    - If so, why are they increasing? (Are there any trends in the data that explain the increases?)
2. Are more students achieving the benchmark score after sitting for the redesigned SAT?

## Executive Summary

The SAT format was changed in 2016, resulting in changes in educational policy in several states in the US. This project aims to examine the impact of this change, and what should be done to capitalise on this change moving forward.

The research reveals a strong negative correlation of approximately -0.80 between SAT and ACT participation. As one increases, the other tends to decrease sharply. This is because students who take one test are not likely to take the other, as both are used for the same purpose: college admissions. 

The revamped SAT has been effective at incentivising participation, either by nature of its transparent and less punitive test structure or through government contracts that ensure state sponsorship or incentives for participation. In the case of Illinois and Colorado, both states now offer state-sponsored SAT exams and enjoy full or nearly full participation amongst their high school candidates.

Further investigation reveals that most state averages outperform the national SAT average score, whereas about 50% of all state mean composite scores outperform the national benchmark composite score. This suggests that the SAT may be better-structured, allowing for higher achievement without compromising the quality of tests. This may also be due to the removal of punitive scoring, where wrong answers were given deductions.

There are, however, limitations to this project's analysis. There are not enough samples of data to conclusively prove that the change in the SAT's structure is effective and will have long-lasting impact. 

It is therefore recommended to:
- Continue gathering data for the new test
- Factor in student populations in data to give context to participation levels
- Obtain more government contracts for delivery of SAT exams
- Persuade more colleges to offer incentives to students to take SATs instead of ACTs, such as higher scholarship awards and better perks.
